\section{Introduction}

\textcolor{blue}{what is swarm, swarm is good}

Swarm robotics draws inspiration from collective behaviors in social animals such as ants, birds, and fish
    \cite{bonabeau1999swarm}.  % the book of Swarm intelligence
Early models like Reynolds' Boids demonstrated that simple local behavioral rules can give rise to coherent large-scale patterns
    \cite{reynolds1987flocks}.
Swarm Robotics aims to leverage these principles to construct decentralized robotic systems that are scalable, adaptive, and fault tolerant
    \cite{dorigo2014swarm,    % scholarpedia on swarm robotics
          dorigo2020reflections,
          dorigo2021swarm}.    %past, present and future
These decentralized systems have shown advantages in large-scale or spatially distributed tasks, including
    environmental monitoring
    \cite{talamali2021less},
    navigation and transportation
    \cite{dorigo2013swarmanoid},
    self-assembly
    \cite{rubenstein2014programmable},
    and collective construction
    \cite{team2012designing, petersen2019review}.

\textcolor{blue}{but, macro, micro problem, and swarm is not always efficient}

However, despite significant progress, it remains a fundamental scientific question to connect low-level individual robot behaviors to the desired high-level collective outcomes, known as micro-marco problem
    \cite{dorigo2021swarm}.
Despite that various theoretical frameworks have been proposed
    \cite{hamann2008framework,
          hamann2010space,
          hamann2018swarm,
          hamann2013towards}
and decentralized controllers have been demonstrated for specific tasks
    \cite{dorigo2004evolving,
          nouyan2009teamwork,
          dorigo2013swarmanoid,
          rubenstein2014programmable,
          li2019decentralized},
yet purely decentralized swarms often face fundamental inefficiencies in environmental analyzing and decision making, particularly due to their reliance on strictly local information
    \cite{dorigo2021swarm,
          kengyel2015potential}. % pure flat is not good

\textcolor{blue}{Therefore, hierarchical}

These limitations motivate research into hybrid and hierarchical approaches that integrate selective forms of centralization into decentralized systems,
These systems seek to bypass the micro-macro problem and increase the global efficiency of a decentralized system and, in the meantime, keep the scalability and fault tolerance features.

\textcolor{blue}{In this chapter, we review}

This chapter reviews prior work in hybrid and hierarchical swarm control,
compares decentralized and centralized approaches across key swarm robotics tasks,
and examines related developments in formation control, coverage, manageability, re-programming, and swarm autonomy.

\section{Heterogeneous, Hybrid, and hierarchical Approaches}

\textcolor{blue}{flat swarms}

Flat and homogeneous swarms, as their classic nature inspiration
    \cite{buhl2006disorder,
          detrain2008collective,
          theraulaz1998origin},
assume that all agents are identical and follow the same behavioral rules
    \cite{viragh2014flocking,
          vasarhelyi2018optimized,
          floreano2008bio,
          csahin2004swarm,
          beni1988concept}.
Such systems excel in robustness and scalability but struggle with tasks that require differentiated roles, long-range coordination, or efficient global organization.

\textcolor{blue}{heterogeneous}

Opposite to that, heterogeneous swarms consist of individuals serving different roles.
These systems,
with individuals in different physical types or with different information,
can often outperform purely homogeneous systems
    \cite{kengyel2015potential}. % hetero is better

Informed or persistent agents can influence the behavior of others during tasks such as flocking or collective decision-making
    \cite{firat2020self, % use informal individual to cue the whole swarm to aggreate to a desired shelter
          valentini2016collective,
          balazs2020adaptive}.
\textcolor{red}{varify: valentini2016collective is not a good choice, find another decision making with stubborn individuals}
Some works explicitly name these individuals as leaders
    \cite{gu2009leader,
          amraii2014explicit}.
\textcolor{red}{consider drop:}
These leaders may be vulnerable to adversarial detection, a concern explored in
    \cite{zheng2020adversarial}.

\textcolor{blue}{hierarchical}

On the other hand, hierarchical approaches impose an additional topological organization on the swarm,
allowing information to flow in a more structured manner
and thereby improving efficiency in tasks
such as flocking
    \cite{dalmao2011cucker,
          jia2019modelling,
          pignotti2018flocking},
and self-assembly or formation
    \cite{li2019decentralized,
          divband2019photomorphogenesis}.
Such approaches can be regarded as highly heterogeneous systems in which each individual assumes its own role.

However,
maintaining scalability and avoiding single points of failure in these systems often require sophisticated mechanisms,
such as temporary leadership, explicit role assignments, or distributed authority-transfer schemes.
In other words, constructing hierarchy in a truly self-organized manner remains a major challenge
    \cite{dorigo2020reflections}.
As task complexity increases, researchers increasingly recognize the importance of self-organized hierarchy, a capability still largely absent in classical decentralized swarms.

\section{Swarm vs. centralized approaches for different tasks}

\textcolor{blue}{The point is}
\textcolor{blue}{1 we want to show there is a gap :  self-organized hierarchy}
\textcolor{blue}{2 both sides have some downsides}

Purely decentralized swarms are highly scalable and fault tolerant but often lack efficiency, especially when global information is required.
Centralized systems, by contrast, achieve high precision and optimal coordination but lose scalability and fault tolerance.
This section reviews these trade-offs across major tasks in multi-robot systems.

\subsection{Formation}

Formation control is one of the most fundamental research topics in multi-robot and swarm systems
    \cite{liu2018survey,
          oh2015survey}. % surveys
Most decentralized formation controllers rely on relative localization, using distance sensors, ultraviolet markers, or fiducial markers
    \cite{walter2018fast, %localization of UaVs using ultraviolet 
          ulrich2022towards}.  %fast fiducial marker with full 6 dof pose estimation

\subsubsection{Fixed-Role Approaches}

Classical methods assume that each robot is preassigned a fixed target position.
During deployment,
robots move according to the positions of predefined neighbors,
making motion control decentralized
but role specification effectively centralized.
These approaches achieve stable rigid-body formations using distance- or bearing-based constraints
    \cite{yang2018growing,
          mehdifar2018finite,
          stacey2015passivity}.
\textcolor{red}{distance rigidity.}
Bearing rigidity theory
    \cite{zhao2019bearing,
          zhao2015bearing}
further allows formation maintenance using only bearing measurements, with two designated leaders controlling scale, rotation, and translation while other robots maintain relative bearings
    \cite{zhao2015translational,
          schiano2016rigidity,
          li2020adaptive,
          li2021adaptive,
          li2020bearing,
          zhao2021finite,
          zhang2022distributed,
          zhang2023bearing}. % for water surface
Switching formations under rigid-body assumptions has also been explored
    \cite{desai1999control,
          desai2002modeling}.

Overall, these methods emphasize control-theoretic guarantees over flexibility or adaptivity, assuming fixed roles and full knowledge of the desired formation.

\subsubsection{Switching Roles}

\textcolor{blue}{Why role switching is important}

One required feature of swarm robotics is self-organized role assignment.
An efficient role assignment can reduce individual robot movements and thereby accelerate formation.
However, in large swarms or environments prone to agent failures, preassigning roles is often impractical.
Some self-assembly approaches allow robots to autonomously select vacant positions, but these methods are often inefficient due to random search
    \cite{rubenstein2014programmable,
          li2019decentralized}.

Centralized algorithms, by contrast, can compute globally optimal role assignments by leveraging full knowledge of robot and formation positions
    \cite{rm2020review,
          macalpine2015scram,
          agarwal2018simultaneous,
          ravichandar2020strata,
          akella2020assignment},
ensuring minimal total displacement or collision-free paths.

\textcolor{blue}{distributed assignment}

Distributed assignment strategies attempt to reduce centralization by dividing computational responsibilities among robots,
using consensus, market-based coordination, or distributed optimization to approximate optimal assignments
    \cite{mosteo2017optimal,
          burger2012distributed,
          chopra2017distributed,
          zavlanos2007distributed,
          alonso2016distributed,
          michael2008distributed,
          montijano2014efficient,
          wang2020shape}.
Despite these efforts, current distributed methods still struggle to scale efficiently with swarm size, as the calculation load of each individual scales up with the swarm scale.
Approaches handling faulty or interchangeable agents also remain limited
    \cite{kambayashi2018distributed}.

These observations highlight a critical gap in terms of role assignment in swarm formation:
while centralized approaches provide optimal coordination
and decentralized swarms provide robustness and scalability,
self-organized hierarchy for role allocation remain largely underexplored.
Developing such mechanisms is essential for achieving both efficiency and resilience in large-scale, formation tasks.

\subsection{Coverage}

For coverage, usually three classes:
    \cite{wang2011coverage} % a survey
    \cite{galceran2013survey} % survey
1. Make the sensors scatter and cover the area.
They happen in a decentralized way.
    \cite{santos2019decentralized}
    \cite{luo2018adaptive}
    \cite{spanogianopoulos2017fast}
    \cite{siligardi2019robust}
2. wandering exploration
    \cite{huang2019exploration} random
    \cite{ichikawa1999characteristics} random
    \cite{mcguire2019minimal} touch and walk along the wall.

3. textcolor{blue}{sweep to cover, S shape path}
The other is to sweep an area, this usually pre-defines the paths of each robot.
    \cite{almadhoun2019survey} % a survey, talked about sweep coverage
    \cite{avellar2015multi}

\cite{scherer2015autonomous} is a mix, centralized for path planning, after target, decentralized for connection establishment.

\subsection{Path Planning}

\textcolor{red}{path planning, goes to other places, maybe obstacle avoidance, or simply drop them.}
\textcolor{red}{Aryo include them as offline under coverage, but they are not really about coverage}

\textcolor{blue}{navigation, not really about coverage, only from A to B through obstacles}

For navigation : offline centralized way for path planning
    \cite{nazarahari2019multi}

\section{Fault tolerance}

Fault tolerance is a default feature for swarm
    \cite{dorigo2014swarm}
    \cite{hamann2018swarm}
.
\textcolor{red}{cite/explainTha some normal fault tolerance, that is not for centralized, predetermined}

but a swarm is sucepetable to intermittent faults IFs
    \cite{zhou2019review}
    \cite{niu2021distributed}
.

To detect IFs, centralized methods are efficient
    \cite{sheng2021intermittent}
    \cite{zhang2021intermittent}
    \cite{syed2016novel}
.4

To make swarm also tolerant to IFs, hybrid methods are considered
    \textcolor{red}{cite Sinan's paper}
    \cite{ouguz2025proactive}

\section{Manageability} \textcolor{red}{adjust this word}

Human needs to supervise a swarm : interact, steer, reprogram.

However the difficulty is, when scale up, human operator can't communicate with all the robot.
