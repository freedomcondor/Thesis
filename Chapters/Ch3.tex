\textit{In this chapter, we will present the design and implementation of the SoNS framework.}

\section{SoNS Framework}

\subsection{Relative Sensing}

A drone see one ground robot by camera.

A ground robot see a drone by reverse calculation.

Two drones see one ground robot, and see each other.

One drone see two ground robots, and ground robots see each other.

\subsection{Tree Topology Establishment}

Robots connected to each other coordicated by a random number.

\subsection{Topology Switching}

A parent handover a child to adjacent robot.

\subsection{Scale Summarize}

A robot collects population from its children, and sends the summation to its parent.

\subsection{Formation and Task Assignment}

Start from the brain, robots finds its best position in the formation.
