1 often draws
2 Boids is not for swarm robotics    match boids to swarm robotics
3 advantages != benefits
4 SO applies to many tasks   !=  show advantages
5 why large-scale and spatially 

6 connect -> two way, but we care for one-way    connect -> design
7 fundamental inefficiencis -> explain

00000   key tasks -> establish key
00000   Manageability -{ fault tolerance, swarm - repro, swarm auto }

flat swarms -> mention interaction

81, downs go to intro section -> remove senteence


hetero- sometimes better

explain persistent agents

adversial detection, not only, and explain.  comment out, and see if it fit to somewhere else

mention leader-follower  check Sci-Ro


efficiency : 
   1 ease of design / manigibility
   2 short time    sometimes 1 is important
   
in 2.1 mention these, and use these to efficiency

too specific for hierarchical downssides



1. efficiency
2. something not introduced
2. terms I do not mention beforee
3. claim not cited
