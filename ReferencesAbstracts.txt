Flocks, herds and schools: A distributed behavioral model

The aggregate motion of a flock of birds, a herd of land animals, or a school of fish is a beautiful and familiar part of the natural world. But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.

鸟群、陆地动物群或鱼群的整体运动，是自然界中美丽且熟悉的景象。但这种复杂的运动很少出现在计算机动画中。本文探索了一种基于模拟的方法，用来替代为每只鸟分别编写运动路径。模拟的鸟群源自粒子系统模型的扩展，其中模拟的鸟就是粒子。模拟鸟群的整体运动由一种分布式行为模型产生，这与自然鸟群中的机制非常相似：鸟会自行选择飞行路线。每只模拟鸟都作为一个独立的“行为体”实现，它根据对动态环境的局部感知、支配其运动的模拟物理规律，以及由“动画师”预设的一组行为进行导航。模拟鸟群的整体运动，是个体模拟鸟那些相对简单的行为之间密集交互的结果。

Swarm robotics: Past, present, and future [point of view]

Swarm robotics deals with the design, construction, and deployment of large groups of robots that coordinate and cooperatively solve a problem or perform a task. It takes inspiration from natural self-organizing systems, such as social insects, fish schools, or bird flocks, characterized by emergent collective behavior based on simple local interaction rules [1], [2]. Typically, swarm robotics extracts engineering principles from the study of those natural systems in order to provide multirobot systems with comparable abilities. This way, it aims to build systems that are more robust, fault-tolerant, and flexible than single robots and that can better adapt their behavior to changes in the environment.

群体机器人学研究大规模机器人集群的设计、构建与部署，这些机器人通过协同配合解决问题或执行任务。该领域从社会性昆虫、鱼群、鸟群等自然自组织系统中汲取灵感，这类系统的核心特征是基于简单局部交互规则产生涌现性集体行为 [1][2]。通常，群体机器人学通过研究这些自然系统提炼工程原理，为多机器人系统赋予类似能力。其目标是构建出比单个机器人更稳健、容错性更强、灵活性更高的系统，且这类系统能更好地根据环境变化调整自身行为。

When less is more: Robot swarms adapt better to changes with constrained communication

To effectively perform collective monitoring of dynamic environments, a robot swarm needs to adapt to changes by processing the latest information and discarding outdated beliefs. We show that in a swarm composed of robots relying on local sensing, adaptation is better achieved if the robots have a shorter rather than longer communication range. This result is in contrast with the widespread belief that more communication links always improve the information exchange on a network. We tasked robots with reaching agreement on the best option currently available in their operating environment. We propose a variety of behaviors composed of reactive rules to process environmental and social information. Our study focuses on simple behaviors based on the voter model—a well-known minimal protocol to regulate social interactions—that can be implemented in minimalistic machines. Although different from each other, all behaviors confirm the general result: The ability of the swarm to adapt improves when robots have fewer communication links. The average number of links per robot reduces when the individual communication range or the robot density decreases. The analysis of the swarm dynamics via mean-field models suggests that our results generalize to other systems based on the voter model. Model predictions are confirmed by results of multiagent simulations and experiments with 50 Kilobot robots. Limiting the communication to a local neighborhood is a cheap decentralized solution to allow robot swarms to adapt to previously unknown information that is locally observed by a minority of the robots.

为有效对动态环境开展集体监测，机器人群体需通过处理最新信息、摒弃过时认知来适应环境变化。研究表明，在由依赖局部感知的机器人组成的群体中，机器人通信范围越短，适应性表现越优。这一结果与 “更多通信链路总能提升网络信息交换效率” 的普遍认知相悖。
我们为机器人设定的任务是，就其运行环境中当前可用的最优选项达成共识。我们提出了多种由反应式规则构成的行为模式，用于处理环境与社交信息。本研究聚焦于基于投票者模型的简单行为 —— 投票者模型是一种知名的极简社交交互调控协议，可在简易设备中实现。尽管这些行为模式各有不同，但均印证了核心结论：机器人通信链路越少，群体的适应能力越强。
单个机器人的平均通信链路数会随个体通信范围缩小或机器人密度降低而减少。通过平均场模型对群体动态的分析表明，我们的结论可推广至其他基于投票者模型的系统。多智能体仿真结果及 50 个 Kilobot 机器人的实验数据，均验证了模型预测的有效性。将通信限制在局部邻域内，是一种低成本的分布式解决方案，能使机器人群体对少数机器人局部观测到的未知信息做出适应性调整。

Swarmanoid: a novel concept for the study of heterogeneous robotic swarms

Swarm robotics systems are characterized by decentralized control, limited communication between robots, use of local information, and emergence of global behavior. Such systems have shown their potential for flexibility and robustness [1]-[3]. However, existing swarm robotics systems are by and large still limited to displaying simple proof-of-concept behaviors under laboratory conditions. It is our contention that one of the factors holding back swarm robotics research is the almost universal insistence on homogeneous system components. We believe that swarm robotics designers must embrace heterogeneity if they ever want swarm robotics systems to approach the complexity required of real-world systems.

群体机器人系统的特征包括分布式控制、机器人间有限通信、局部信息利用以及全局行为涌现。这类系统已展现出灵活性与稳健性的潜力 [1]-[3]。
然而，现有群体机器人系统大体上仍局限于在实验室条件下展示简单的概念验证行为。我们认为，阻碍群体机器人学研究发展的因素之一，是对系统组件同质性的近乎普遍的执着。若想让群体机器人系统达到实际应用场景所需的复杂程度，设计者必须接纳组件异质性这一理念。

Programmable self-assembly in a thousand-robot swarm

Self-assembly enables nature to build complex forms, from multicellular organisms to complex animal structures such as flocks of birds, through the interaction of vast numbers of limited and unreliable individuals. Creating this ability in engineered systems poses challenges in the design of both algorithms and physical systems that can operate at such scales. We report a system that demonstrates programmable self-assembly of complex two-dimensional shapes with a thousand-robot swarm. This was enabled by creating autonomous robots designed to operate in large groups and to cooperate through local interactions and by developing a collective algorithm for shape formation that is highly robust to the variability and error characteristic of large-scale decentralized systems. This work advances the aim of creating artificial swarms with the capabilities of natural ones.

自组装让自然界能够通过大量功能有限且可靠性不高的个体间的相互作用，构建出复杂结构 —— 从多细胞生物到鸟群等复杂的动物集群结构皆如此。
在工程系统中实现这种能力，面临着算法设计和物理系统设计的双重挑战，这些系统需能在如此大规模下运行。我们报道了一个系统，该系统可实现千机器人集群对复杂二维形状的可编程自组装。
这一成果的实现，一方面得益于设计出能在大规模群体中运行、并通过局部交互协同工作的自主机器人；另一方面则是开发了一套形状形成的群体算法，该算法对大规模分布式系统特有的变异性和误差具有高度稳健性。这项研究推动了构建具备自然群体能力的人工集群这一目标的实现。

Designing collective behavior in a termite-inspired robot

Complex systems are characterized by many independent components whose low-level actions produce collective high-level results. Predicting high-level results given low-level rules is a key open challenge; the inverse problem, finding low-level rules that give specific outcomes, is in general still less understood. We present a multi-agent construction system inspired by mound-building termites, solving such an inverse problem. A user specifies a desired structure, and the system automatically generates low-level rules for independent climbing robots that guarantee production of that structure. Robots use only local sensing and coordinate their activity via the shared environment. We demonstrate the approach via a physical realization with three autonomous climbing robots limited to onboard sensing. This work advances the aim of engineering complex systems that achieve specific human-designed goals.

复杂系统的特征是存在大量独立组件，这些组件的低层级行为会产生集体性的高层级结果。已知低层级规则时预测高层级结果，是一项关键的开放性挑战；而反向问题 —— 即寻找能产生特定结果的低层级规则，总体上仍未被充分理解。
我们提出了一个受堆丘白蚁启发的多智能体构建系统，用于解决这一反向问题。用户指定所需结构后，该系统会自动为自主攀爬机器人生成低层级规则，确保生成目标结构。机器人仅依靠局部感知，并通过共享环境协调自身活动。
我们通过三台自主攀爬机器人的物理实物验证了该方法，这些机器人仅依赖机载传感设备。这项研究推动了 “设计能实现人类特定目标的复杂工程系统” 这一目标的进展。

Autonomously shaping natural climbing plants: a bio-hybrid approach

Plant growth is a self-organized process incorporating distributed sensing, internal communication and morphology dynamics. We develop a distributed mechatronic system that autonomously interacts with natural climbing plants, steering their behaviours to grow user-defined shapes and patterns. Investigating this bio-hybrid system paves the way towards the development of living adaptive structures and grown building components. In this new application domain, challenges include sensing, actuation and the combination of engineering methods and natural plants in the experimental set-up. By triggering behavioural responses in the plants through light spectra stimuli, we use static mechatronic nodes to grow climbing plants in a user-defined pattern at a two-dimensional plane. The experiments show successful growth over periods up to eight weeks. Results of the stimuli-guided experiments are substantially different from the control experiments. Key limitations are the number of repetitions performed and the scale of the systems tested. Recommended future research would investigate the use of similar bio-hybrids to connect construction elements and grow shapes of larger size.

植物生长是一个融合分布式感知、内部信号传递与形态动态变化的自组织过程。我们开发了一套分布式机电系统，可自主与自然攀爬植物交互，引导其生长出用户自定义的形状和图案。
研究这种生物混合系统，为开发活体自适应结构和生长型建筑构件奠定了基础。在这一新应用领域，面临的挑战包括传感、驱动技术的研发，以及实验装置中工程方法与自然植物的融合应用。
通过光谱刺激触发植物的行为响应，我们利用静态机电节点，引导攀爬植物在二维平面上按用户设定的图案生长。实验显示，植物可成功生长长达八周。刺激引导组的实验结果与对照组存在显著差异。
该研究的主要局限性在于实验重复次数较少以及测试系统的规模有限。未来建议研究方向包括利用类似生物混合系统连接建筑构件，以及培育更大尺寸的生长形态。

Social integration of robots into groups of cockroaches to control self-organized choices

Collective behavior based on self-organization has been shown in group-living animals from insects to vertebrates. These findings have stimulated engineers to investigate approaches for the coordination of autonomous multirobot systems based on self-organization. In this experimental study, we show collective decision-making by mixed groups of cockroaches and socially integrated autonomous robots, leading to shared shelter selection. Individuals, natural or artificial, are perceived as equivalent, and the collective decision emerges from nonlinear feedbacks based on local interactions. Even when in the minority, robots can modulate the collective decision-making process and produce a global pattern not observed in their absence. These results demonstrate the possibility of using intelligent autonomous devices to study and control self-organized behavioral patterns in group-living animals.

从昆虫到脊椎动物，群居动物中已发现基于自组织的集体行为。这些发现启发工程师研究基于自组织的自主多机器人系统协调方法。
在这项实验研究中，我们展示了蟑螂与社会化融合自主机器人组成的混合群体的集体决策过程，最终实现共享庇护所选择。无论是自然个体还是人工个体，都被视为等价主体，集体决策源于基于局部交互的非线性反馈。
即便机器人占少数，仍能调节集体决策过程，产生无机器人时未观察到的全局模式。这些结果表明，可利用智能自主设备研究并控制群居动物的自组织行为模式。

A framework of space--time continuous models for algorithm design in swarm robotics

Designing and analyzing self-organizing systems such as robotic swarms is a challenging task even though we have complete knowledge about the robot’s interior. It is difficult to determine the individual robot’s behavior based on the swarm behavior and vice versa due to the high number of agent–agent interactions. A step towards a solution of this problem is the development of appropriate models which accurately predict the swarm behavior based on a specified control algorithm. Such models would reduce the necessary number of time-consuming simulations and experiments during the design process of an algorithm. In this paper we propose a model with focus on an explicit representation of space because the effectiveness of many swarm robotic scenarios depends on spatial inhomogeneity. We use methods of statistical physics to address spatiality. Starting from a description of a single robot we derive an abstract model of swarm motion. The model is then extended to a generic model framework of communicating robots. In two examples we validate models against simulation results. Our experience shows that qualitative correctness is easily achieved, while quantitative correctness is disproportionately more difficult but still possible.

即便完全了解机器人的内部构造，设计和分析机器人群体等自组织系统仍是一项艰巨任务。由于智能体间存在大量交互，很难根据群体行为确定单个机器人的行为，反之亦然。
解决这一问题的关键一步是开发合适的模型，这些模型能基于特定控制算法准确预测群体行为。此类模型可减少算法设计过程中耗时的仿真和实验次数。本文提出一种模型，重点在于对空间的显式表征 —— 因为许多群体机器人场景的有效性依赖于空间非均质性。
我们采用统计物理方法处理空间特性，从单个机器人的描述出发，推导出群体运动的抽象模型。随后，该模型被扩展为适用于通信机器人的通用模型框架。通过两个实例，我们将模型与仿真结果进行验证。经验表明，实现定性准确性较为容易，而定量准确性虽难度显著更高，但仍可实现。

Towards swarm calculus: Urn models of collective decisions and universal properties of swarm performance

Methods of general applicability are searched for in swarm intelligence with the aim of gaining new insights about natural swarms and to develop design methodologies for artificial swarms. An ideal solution could be a ‘swarm calculus’ that allows to calculate key features of swarms such as expected swarm performance and robustness based on only a few parameters. To work towards this ideal, one needs to find methods and models with high degrees of generality. In this paper, we report two models that might be examples of exceptional generality. First, an abstract model is presented that describes swarm performance depending on swarm density based on the dichotomy between cooperation and interference. Typical swarm experiments are given as examples to show how the model fits to several different results. Second, we give an abstract model of collective decision making that is inspired by urn models. The effects of positive-feedback probability, that is increasing over time in a decision making system, are understood by the help of a parameter that controls the feedback based on the swarm’s current consensus. Several applicable methods, such as the description as Markov process, calculation of splitting probabilities, mean first passage times, and measurements of positive feedback, are discussed and applications to artificial and natural swarms are reported.

群体智能领域正寻求具有普适性的方法，旨在深入理解自然群体的特性，并为人工群体开发设计方法。理想的解决方案可能是一种 “群体演算”，仅通过少数参数就能计算出群体的关键特征，如预期性能和稳健性。
为实现这一理想目标，需探索具有高度普适性的方法与模型。本文提出两个可能具备极高普适性的模型。其一为抽象模型，基于 “协作与干扰” 的二分法，描述群体性能随群体密度的变化规律，并通过典型群体实验实例验证该模型对多种不同结果的适配性。其二为受 urn 模型（ urn models，即瓮模型）启发的集体决策抽象模型。该模型通过一个基于群体当前共识调控反馈的参数，阐释决策系统中随时间递增的正反馈概率所产生的影响。
文中还讨论了多种适用方法，如马尔可夫过程描述、分裂概率计算、平均首达时间分析及正反馈度量，并报道了这些方法在人工群体与自然群体中的应用。

Efficient decision-making in a self-organizing robot swarm: On the speed versus accuracy trade-off

We study a self-organized collective decision-making strategy to solve the best-of-n decision problem in a swarm of robots. We define a distributed and iterative decision-making strategy. Using this strategy, robots explore the available options, determine the options' qualities, decide autonomously which option to take, and communicate their decision to neighboring robots. We study the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed strategy using a swarm of 100 Kilobots. We study the well-known speed versus accuracy trade-off analytically by developing a mean-field model. Compared to a previously published simpler method, our decision-making strategy shows a considerable speed-up but has lower accuracy. We analyze our decision-making strategy with particular focus on how the spatial density of robots impacts the dynamics of decisions. The number of neighboring robots is found to influence the speed and accuracy of the decision-making process. Larger neighborhoods speed up the decision but lower its accuracy. We observe that the parity of the neighborhood cardinality determines whether the system will over- or under-perform.

我们研究了一种自组织集体决策策略，用于解决机器人群体中的 “n 选优” 决策问题。我们定义了一种分布式迭代决策策略，机器人通过该策略探索可用选项、评估选项质量、自主决定选择方案，并向相邻机器人传递决策信息。
我们利用 100 个 Kilobot 机器人组成的群体，验证了所提策略的有效性与稳健性。通过建立平均场模型进行解析分析，研究了经典的 “速度 - 精度” 权衡关系。与已发表的简化方法相比，我们的决策策略在速度上有显著提升，但精度相对较低。
我们重点分析了机器人空间密度对决策动态的影响，发现相邻机器人数量会左右决策过程的速度与精度：更大的邻域范围能加快决策速度，但会降低决策精度。此外，邻域基数的奇偶性会决定系统表现是优于还是劣于预期水平。

Evolving self-organizing behaviors for a swarm-bot

In this paper, we introduce a self-assembling and self-organizing artifact, called a swarm-bot, composed of a swarm of s-bots, mobile robots with the ability to connect to and to disconnect from each other. We discuss the challenges involved in controlling a swarm-bot and address the problem of synthesizing controllers for the swarm-bot using artificial evolution. Specifically, we study aggregation and coordinated motion of the swarm-bot using a physics-based simulation of the system. Experiments, using a simplified simulation model of the s-bots, show that evolution can discover simple but effective controllers for both the aggregation and the coordinated motion of the swarm-bot. Analysis of the evolved controllers shows that they have properties of scalability, that is, they continue to be effective for larger group sizes, and of generality, that is, they produce similar behaviors for configurations different from those they were originally evolved for. The portability of the evolved controllers to real s-bots is tested using a detailed simulation model which has been validated against the real s-bots in a companion paper in this same special issue.

本文介绍了一种自组装、自组织的人工装置，称为 “群体机器人集群（swarm-bot）”，它由一群 “单体机器人（s-bots）” 组成。这些单体机器人是具备相互连接与断开能力的移动机器人。
我们探讨了控制群体机器人集群所面临的挑战，并提出采用人工进化方法为其设计控制器的解决方案。具体而言，我们通过基于物理的系统仿真，研究了群体机器人集群的聚集行为与协调运动。利用单体机器人的简化仿真模型进行的实验表明，进化算法能够发现简单且高效的控制器，分别实现群体机器人集群的聚集与协调运动。
对进化所得控制器的分析显示，它们具备可扩展性 —— 即对更大规模的群体仍保持有效性，同时具备通用性 —— 即针对与进化时不同的配置，仍能产生相似行为。我们通过一个详细仿真模型测试了这些进化控制器在真实单体机器人上的可移植性，该详细模型已在本期特刊的另一篇配套论文中通过真实单体机器人验证。

Teamwork in self-organized robot colonies

Swarm robotics draws inspiration from decentralized self-organizing biological systems in general and from the collective behavior of social insects in particular. In social insect colonies, many tasks are performed by higher order group or team entities, whose task-solving capacities transcend those of the individual participants. In this paper, we investigate the emergence of such higher order entities. We report on an experimental study in which a team of physical robots performs a foraging task. The robots are "identical" in hardware and control. They make little use of memory and take actions purely on the basis of local information. Our study advances the current state of the art in swarm robotics with respect to the number of real-world robots engaging in teamwork (up to 12 robots in the most challenging experiment). To the best of our knowledge, in this paper we present the first self-organized system of robots that displays a dynamical hierarchy of teamwork (with cooperation also occurring among higher order entities). Our study shows that teamwork requires neither individual recognition nor differences between individuals. This result might also contribute to the ongoing debate on the role of these characteristics in the division of labor in social insects.

群体机器人学普遍从分布式自组织生物系统中汲取灵感，尤其聚焦社会性昆虫的集体行为。在社会性昆虫群体中，许多任务由更高层级的群体或团队单元完成，这些单元的任务解决能力超越了单个个体的能力范畴。
本文研究了这类更高层级单元的涌现机制，并报道了一项实验研究 —— 由实体机器人组成的团队执行觅食任务。这些机器人在硬件和控制层面完全 “相同”，几乎不依赖记忆，仅基于局部信息采取行动。
本研究推进了群体机器人学的现有水平，主要体现在参与团队协作的真实机器人数量上（最具挑战性的实验中多达 12 个机器人）。据我们所知，本文首次提出了一个自组织机器人系统，该系统展现出动态的团队协作层级（更高层级单元之间也存在协作）。研究表明，团队协作既不需要个体识别，也不需要个体间存在差异。这一结果或许也能为当前关于这些特征在社会性昆虫分工中作用的争论提供参考。

Decentralized progressive shape formation with robot swarms

We address the problem of progressively deploying a set of robots to a formation defined as a point cloud, in a decentralized manner. To achieve this, we present an algorithm that transforms a given point cloud into an acyclic directed graph. This graph is used by the control law to allow a swarm of robots to progressively form the target shape based only on local decisions. This means that free robots (i.e., not yet part of the formation) find their location based on the perceived location of the robots already in the formation. We prove that for a 2D shape it is sufficient for a free robot to compute its distance from two robots in the formation to achieve this objective. We validate our method using physics-based simulations and robotic experiments, showing consistent convergence and minimal formation placement error.

我们针对机器人集群以分布式方式逐步部署至点云定义阵型的问题展开研究。为此，我们提出一种算法，可将给定的点云转换为无环有向图。该图被用于控制律中，使机器人群体仅通过局部决策逐步形成目标形状。
这意味着自由机器人（即尚未加入阵型的机器人）会根据已在阵型中的机器人的感知位置，确定自身所处位置。我们证明，对于二维形状，自由机器人只需计算自身与阵型中两个机器人的距离，即可实现这一目标。
通过基于物理的仿真和机器人实验，我们验证了该方法的有效性，结果显示其收敛性稳定，且阵型部署误差极小。

eberhardinger2018approach
An approach for isolated testing of self-organization algorithms

We provide a systematic approach for testing self-organization (SO) algorithms. The main challenges for such a testing domain are the strongly ramified state space, the possible error masking, the interleaving of mechanisms, and the oracle problem resulting from the main characteristics of SO algorithms: their inherent non-deterministic behavior on the one hand, and their dynamic environment on the other. A key to success for our SO algorithm testing framework is automation, since it is rarely possible to cope with the ramified state space manually. The test automation is based on a model-based testing approach where probabilistic environment profiles are used to derive test cases that are performed and evaluated on isolated SO algorithms. Besides isolation, we are able to achieve representative test results with respect to a specific application. For illustration purposes, we apply the concepts of our framework to partitioning-based SO algorithms and provide an evaluation in the context of an existing smart-grid application.

我们提出了一种测试自组织（SO）算法的系统化方法。该测试领域面临的主要挑战包括状态空间高度分支化、可能存在的错误掩盖现象、机制的交织叠加，以及由自组织算法核心特征引发的 “预言机问题”—— 一方面是算法固有的非确定性行为，另一方面是动态变化的运行环境。
我们的自组织算法测试框架成功的关键在于自动化，因为手动处理高度分支化的状态空间几乎不现实。测试自动化基于模型驱动测试方法，通过概率环境配置文件生成测试用例，这些用例将在孤立的自组织算法上执行并评估。
除了算法隔离，我们还能针对特定应用场景获得具有代表性的测试结果。为便于说明，我们将该框架的理念应用于基于分区的自组织算法，并结合现有智能电网应用场景进行评估。

Measuring and evaluating the performance of self-organization mechanisms within collective adaptive systems

By restructuring and reconfiguring itself at run-time, a collective adaptive system (CAS) is able to fulfill its requirements under uncertain, ever-changing environmental conditions. Indeed, this process of self-organization (SO) is of utmost importance for the ability of the CAS to perform. However, it is hard to design high-performing SO mechanisms, because the environmental conditions are partially unpredictable at design time. Thus, a crucial aid for the development of SO mechanisms is a tool set enabling performance evaluations at design time in order to select the best-fitting mechanism and parametrize it. We present a metric for measuring the performance of an SO mechanism as well as a framework that enables evaluation of this metric. The proposed metric is evaluated for different kinds of SO mechanisms in two case studies: a smart energy management system and a self-organizing production cell.

集体自适应系统（CAS）能够通过运行时的自我重构与重配置，在不确定、持续变化的环境条件下满足自身需求。事实上，这种自组织（SO）过程对集体自适应系统的运行能力至关重要。
然而，设计高性能的自组织机制并非易事，因为设计阶段难以完全预测环境条件。因此，开发自组织机制的关键辅助工具是一套性能评估工具集，能够在设计阶段开展评估，从而筛选最合适的机制并进行参数优化。
我们提出了一种用于衡量自组织机制性能的指标，以及一套实现该指标评估的框架。在两个案例研究（智能能源管理系统和自组织生产单元）中，我们针对不同类型的自组织机制对该指标进行了验证。

Criteria for the evaluation of self-* systems

In the last years, the growing complexity of the current applications has led to the design of self-adapting systems presenting self-* properties. These systems are composed of several autonomous interactive entities. They behave autonomously and present enhanced characteristics allowing them to handle dynamics coming from exogenous and endogenous changes.
In this paper, we propose a set of criteria for the description and evaluation of the adaptive properties of such systems. They aim to provide a concrete mechanism to analyze the quality of the design of adaptive systems, to evaluate the effect of self-* properties on the performances and to compare the adaptive features of different systems. The criteria are grouped into different categories: methodological, architectural, intrinsic, and runtime evaluation. They have been identified and specified by analyzing several case studies, which address self-adaptivity issues through different approaches with different objectives in various application contexts.

近年来，当前应用的复杂度不断提升，推动了具备 “自特性”（self- properties）的自适应系统的设计与开发。这类系统由多个自主交互的实体组成，能够自主运行并具备增强特性，可应对来自外部和内部变化的动态影响。
本文提出了一套用于描述和评估此类系统自适应特性的标准。这些标准旨在提供一种具体机制，用于分析自适应系统的设计质量、评估 “自 * 特性” 对性能的影响，以及比较不同系统的自适应特征。标准被划分为不同类别：方法学类、架构类、内在特性类和运行时评估类。
这些标准是通过分析多个案例研究确定并明确的，这些案例研究在不同应用场景下，采用不同方法、围绕不同目标解决自适应相关问题。

Network topology and communication-computation tradeoffs in decentralized optimization

In decentralized optimization, nodes cooperate to minimize an overall objective function that is the sum (or average) of per-node private objective functions. Algorithms interleave local computations with communication among all or a subset of the nodes. Motivated by a variety of applications..decentralized estimation in sensor networks, fitting models to massive data sets, and decentralized control of multirobot systems, to name a few..significant advances have been made toward the development of robust, practical algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees. This paper presents an overview of recent work in this area. In general, rates of convergence depend not only on the number of nodes involved and the desired level of accuracy, but also on the structure and nature of the network over which nodes communicate (e.g., whether links are directed or undirected, static or time varying). We survey the state-of-theart algorithms and their analyses tailored to these different scenarios, highlighting the role of the network topology.

分布式优化中，节点通过协作最小化一个整体目标函数，该函数是各节点私有目标函数的总和（或平均值）。算法会交替进行局部计算，以及所有节点或部分节点间的通信。
受多种应用场景的推动 —— 例如传感器网络中的分布式估计、大规模数据集的模型拟合、多机器人系统的分布式控制等 —— 该领域在开发具有理论性能保证的稳健实用算法方面取得了显著进展。本文概述了该领域的近期研究成果。
一般而言，收敛速度不仅取决于参与节点的数量和期望的精度水平，还取决于节点通信网络的结构与特性（例如链路是有向还是无向、静态还是时变）。我们综述了针对这些不同场景的最先进算法及其分析，重点强调了网络拓扑结构的作用。

Controller architectures: Tradeoffs between performance and structure

This review article describes the design of static controllers that achieve an optimal tradeoff between closed-loop performance and controller structure. Our methodology consists of two steps. First, we identify controller structure by incorporating regularization functions into the optimal control problem and, second, we optimize the controller over the identified structure. For large-scale networks of dynamical systems, the desired structural property is captured by limited information exchange between physical and controller layers and the regularization term penalizes the number of communication links. Although structured optimal control problems are, in general, nonconvex, we identify classes of convex problems that arise in the design of symmetric systems, undirected consensus and synchronization networks, optimal selection of sensors and actuators, and decentralized control of positive systems. Examples of consensus networks, drug therapy design, sensor selection in flexible wing aircrafts, and optimal wide-area control of power systems are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework.

本文综述了静态控制器的设计方法，这类控制器能在闭环性能与控制器结构之间实现最优权衡。我们的方法分为两步：第一步通过在最优控制问题中融入正则化函数确定控制器结构；第二步在已确定的结构上对控制器进行优化。
对于大规模动态系统网络，期望的结构特性通过物理层与控制层之间有限的信息交换实现，正则化项则会对通信链路数量进行惩罚。尽管结构化最优控制问题通常是非凸的，但我们发现了几类凸问题，它们出现在对称系统设计、无向一致性与同步网络设计、传感器与执行器最优选择，以及正系统分布式控制中。
文中通过一致性网络、药物治疗方案设计、柔性翼飞行器传感器选择，以及电力系统最优广域控制等实例，验证了该框架的有效性。

Automatic design of robot swarms: achievements and challenges

Automatic design is a promising approach to the design of control software for robot swarms. In an automatic design method, the design problem is cast into an optimization problem and is addressed using an optimization algorithm. In this article, we review studies in which automatic design methods are successfully applied. In particular, we focus our attention on how automatic methods are empirically assessed. An apparent issue that emerges from our review is that a solid, well-established, and consistently applied empirical practice is still missing. For example, studies that propose new methods and ideas do not typically provide any comparison with existing ones. We maintain that the lack of a proper empirical practice hinders the progress of the domain. In this article, we pursue two goals: we highlight the notable achievements in the automatic design of control software for robot swarms and we discuss the challenges to be overcome to establish a proper empirical practice for the domain.

自动设计是机器人群体控制软件设计的一种极具潜力的方法。在自动设计方法中，设计问题会被转化为优化问题，并通过优化算法加以解决。
本文综述了成功应用自动设计方法的相关研究，重点关注这些自动方法的实证评估方式。综述发现一个明显问题：该领域尚未形成一套完善、成熟且统一应用的实证规范。例如，提出新方法和新思路的研究通常不会与现有方法进行对比。我们认为，缺乏规范的实证流程阻碍了该领域的发展。
本文旨在实现两个目标：一是总结机器人群体控制软件自动设计领域的显著成果；二是探讨该领域建立规范实证流程所需克服的挑战。

Automatic off-line design of robot swarms: a manifesto

Designing collective behaviors for robot swarms is a difficult endeavor due to their fully distributed, highly redundant, and ever-changing nature. To overcome the challenge, a few approaches have been proposed, which can be classified as manual, semi-automatic, or automatic design. This paper is intended to be the manifesto of the automatic off-line design for robot swarms. We define the off-line design problem and illustrate it via a possible practical realization, highlight the core research questions, raise a number of issues regarding the existing literature that is relevant to the automatic off-line design, and provide guidelines that we deem necessary for a healthy development of the domain and for ensuring its relevance to potential real-world applications.

机器人群体的集体行为设计极具挑战性，这源于其完全分布式、高度冗余且动态变化的特性。为应对这一挑战，学界已提出多种方法，可分为手动设计、半自动设计和自动设计三类。
本文旨在成为机器人群体离线自动设计的宣言性文献。我们明确了离线设计问题，并通过一种可行的实际实现方案进行阐释；重点指出了核心研究问题；针对与离线自动设计相关的现有文献，提出了若干待解决的问题；同时给出了我们认为对该领域健康发展、确保其与潜在实际应用相关性所必需的指导原则。

Automatic design of stigmergy-based behaviours for robot swarms

Stigmergy is a form of indirect communication and coordination in which individuals influence their peers by modifying the environment in various ways, including rearranging objects in space and releasing chemicals. For example, some ant species lay pheromone trails to efficiently navigate between food sources and nests. Besides being used by social animals, stigmergy has also inspired the development of algorithms for combinatorial optimisation and multi-robot systems. In swarm robotics, collective behaviours based on stigmergy have always been designed manually, which is time consuming, costly, hardly repeatable, and depends on the expertise of the designer. Here, we show that stigmergy-based behaviours can be produced via automatic design: an optimisation process based on simulations generates collective behaviours for a group of robots that can lay and sense artificial pheromones. The results of our experiments indicate that the collective behaviours designed automatically are as good as—and in some cases better than—those produced manually. By taking advantage of pheromone-based stigmergy, the automatic design process generated collective behaviours that exhibit spatial organisation, memory, and communication.

stigmergy（信息素介导协作）是一种间接通信与协调方式，个体通过多种环境改造手段影响同伴，包括调整空间中的物体布局和释放化学物质。例如，某些蚂蚁种类会留下信息素轨迹，以高效往返于食物源和巢穴之间。
除了被群居动物采用，stigmergy 还启发了组合优化算法和多机器人系统的开发。在群体机器人学中，基于 stigmergy 的集体行为一直依赖人工设计 —— 这种方式耗时耗力、难以复现，且取决于设计者的专业经验。
本文提出，基于 stigmergy 的行为可通过自动设计生成：一个基于仿真的优化过程能为一组可释放和感知人工信息素的机器人，生成集体行为。实验结果表明，自动设计的集体行为与人工设计的效果相当，部分情况下甚至更优。借助基于信息素的 stigmergy，自动设计过程生成的集体行为具备空间组织性、记忆能力和通信功能。

Potential of heterogeneity in collective behaviors: A case study on heterogeneous swarms

Research in swarm robotics and collective behaviors is often focused on homogeneous swarms. However, heterogeneity in behaviors can be advantageous as we know, for example, from studies on social insects. Our objective is to study the hypothesis that there are potential advantages of heterogeneous swarms over homogeneous swarms in an aggregation scenario inspired by behaviors of juvenile honeybees. Even without task switching – that is, with predefined, static roles for certain swarm fractions – we find in our case study that heterogeneous swarms can outperform homogeneous swarms for a predetermined set of basic behaviors. We use methods of evolutionary computation to define behaviors imitating those found in honeybees (random walkers, wall followers, goal finders, immobile agents) and also to find well-adapted swarm fractions of different predetermined behaviors. Our results show that non-trivial distributions of behaviors give better aggregation performance.

群体机器人学和集体行为的研究通常聚焦于同质性群体。但正如我们从社会性昆虫研究中所知，行为异质性可能具备优势。
本文旨在验证一个假设：在受幼蜂行为启发的聚集场景中，异质性群体相比同质性群体可能存在潜在优势。研究发现，即便不进行任务切换 —— 即群体中特定比例的个体承担预先设定的固定角色 —— 在本案例研究的一组预设基础行为中，异质性群体的表现仍优于同质性群体。
我们采用进化计算方法，定义了模仿蜜蜂行为的多种行为模式（随机游走者、沿壁追随者、目标寻找者、静止个体），并通过该方法找到不同预设行为的最优群体比例分配。结果表明，非平凡的行为分布能带来更优的聚集性能。

Flocking algorithm for autonomous flying robots

Animal swarms displaying a variety of typical flocking patterns would not exist without the underlying safe, optimal and stable dynamics of the individuals. The emergence of these universal patterns can be efficiently reconstructed with agent-based models. If we want to reproduce these patterns with artificial systems, such as autonomous aerial robots, agent-based models can also be used in their control algorithms. However, finding the proper algorithms and thus understanding the essential characteristics of the emergent collective behaviour requires thorough and realistic modeling of the robot and also the environment. In this paper, we first present an abstract mathematical model of an autonomous flying robot. The model takes into account several realistic features, such as time delay and locality of communication, inaccuracy of the on-board sensors and inertial effects. We present two decentralized control algorithms. One is based on a simple self-propelled flocking model of animal collective motion, the other is a collective target tracking algorithm. Both algorithms contain a viscous friction-like term, which aligns the velocities of neighbouring agents parallel to each other. We show that this term can be essential for reducing the inherent instabilities of such a noisy and delayed realistic system. We discuss simulation results on the stability of the control algorithms, and perform real experiments to show the applicability of the algorithms on a group of autonomous quadcopters. In our case, bio-inspiration works in two ways. On the one hand, the whole idea of trying to build and control a swarm of robots comes from the observation that birds tend to flock to optimize their behaviour as a group. On the other hand, by using a realistic simulation framework and studying the group behaviour of autonomous robots we can learn about the major factors influencing the flight of bird flocks.

若没有个体层面安全、最优且稳定的动态特性，动物群体便无法呈现出多种典型的集群模式。这些通用模式的涌现可通过智能体模型高效重构。若想利用自主空中机器人等人工系统复现这些模式，智能体模型也可应用于其控制算法中。
然而，要找到合适的算法并理解涌现出的集体行为的核心特征，就需要对机器人及环境进行全面且贴合实际的建模。本文首先提出一种自主飞行机器人的抽象数学模型，该模型考虑了多种现实特性，包括通信时延与局部性、机载传感器的不准确性以及惯性效应。
我们设计了两种分布式控制算法：一种基于简单的动物集体运动自驱动集群模型，另一种是集体目标跟踪算法。两种算法均包含类粘性摩擦项，可使相邻智能体的速度相互平行对齐。研究表明，在这类存在噪声和时延的现实系统中，该术语对降低内在不稳定性至关重要。
我们讨论了控制算法稳定性的仿真结果，并通过真实实验验证了算法在一组自主四旋翼飞行器上的适用性。本研究中，生物启发体现在两个方面：一方面，构建和控制机器人群体的灵感源于观察到鸟类通过集群优化群体行为；另一方面，借助贴合实际的仿真框架并研究自主机器人的群体行为，我们能够了解影响鸟群飞行的主要因素。

Optimized flocking of autonomous drones in confined environments

We address a fundamental issue of collective motion of aerial robots: how to ensure that large flocks of autonomous drones seamlessly navigate in confined spaces. The numerous existing flocking models are rarely tested on actual hardware because they typically neglect some crucial aspects of multirobot systems. Constrained motion and communication capabilities, delays, perturbations, or the presence of barriers should be modeled and treated explicitly because they have large effects on collective behavior during the cooperation of real agents. Handling these issues properly results in additional model complexity and a natural increase in the number of tunable parameters, which calls for appropriate optimization methods to be coupled tightly to model development. In this paper, we propose such a flocking model for real drones incorporating an evolutionary optimization framework with carefully chosen order parameters and fitness functions. We numerically demonstrated that the induced swarm behavior remained stable under realistic conditions for large flock sizes and notably for large velocities. We showed that coherent and realistic collective motion patterns persisted even around perturbing obstacles. Furthermore, we validated our model on real hardware, carrying out field experiments with a self-organized swarm of 30 drones. This is the largest of such aerial outdoor systems without central control reported to date exhibiting flocking with collective collision and object avoidance. The results confirmed the adequacy of our approach. Successfully controlling dozens of quadcopters will enable substantially more efficient task management in various contexts involving drones.

我们针对空中机器人集体运动的一个核心问题展开研究：如何确保大规模自主无人机集群在受限空间内无缝导航。现有众多集群模型很少在实际硬件上测试，因为它们通常忽略了多机器人系统的一些关键特性。
受约束的运动与通信能力、时延、扰动以及障碍物的存在，都需要明确建模和处理 —— 因为这些因素会对真实智能体协作时的集体行为产生重大影响。妥善处理这些问题会增加模型复杂度，且自然导致可调参数数量增多，这就需要将合适的优化方法与模型开发紧密结合。
本文提出一种适用于真实无人机的集群模型，该模型融入了进化优化框架，并精心选择了序参量和适应度函数。数值仿真表明，在真实环境条件下，该模型诱导的群体行为对大规模集群和高速度场景均保持稳定；即便在障碍物扰动环境中，连贯且贴合实际的集体运动模式依然存在。
此外，我们通过真实硬件验证了该模型，利用 30 架无人机组成的自组织集群开展了户外实验。这是目前已报道的最大规模无中心控制户外空中集群系统，能够实现集群飞行，并具备集体避撞和避障能力。实验结果证实了我们方法的有效性。成功控制数十架四旋翼飞行器，将能在各类无人机应用场景中显著提升任务管理效率。

Swarm robotics: From sources of inspiration to domains of application

Swarm robotics is a novel approach to the coordination of large numbers of relatively simple robots which takes its inspiration from social insects. This paper proposes a definition to this newly emerging approach by 1) describing the desirable properties of swarm robotic systems, as observed in the system-level functioning of social insects, 2) proposing a definition for the term swarm robotics, and putting forward a set of criteria that can be used to distinguish swarm robotics research from other multi-robot studies, 3) providing a review of some studies which can act as sources of inspiration, and a list of promising domains for the utilization of swarm robotic systems.

From disorder to order in marching locusts

Recent models from theoretical physics have predicted that mass-migrating animal groups may share group-level properties, irrespective of the type of animals in the group. One key prediction is that as the density of animals in the group increases, a rapid transition occurs from disordered movement of individuals within the group to highly aligned collective motion. Understanding such a transition is crucial to the control of mobile swarming insect pests such as the desert locust. We confirmed the prediction of a rapid transition from disordered to ordered movement and identified a critical density for the onset of coordinated marching in locust nymphs. We also demonstrated a dynamic instability in motion at densities typical of locusts in the field, in which groups can switch direction without external perturbation, potentially facilitating the rapid transfer of directional information.

理论物理学的近期模型预测，大规模迁徙的动物群体可能具备群体层面的共性特征，与群体中动物的种类无关。其中一个核心预测是：随着群体内动物密度的增加，个体的无序运动将快速转变为高度同步的集体运动。
理解这种转变对于控制沙漠蝗等迁飞性害虫群体至关重要。我们通过实验验证了 “无序运动向有序运动快速转变” 的预测，并确定了蝗蝻开始协同行进的临界密度。同时，我们还发现在野外蝗群典型密度下，其运动存在动态不稳定性 —— 群体可在无外部扰动的情况下改变行进方向，这可能有助于方向信息的快速传递。

Collective decision-making and foraging patterns in ants and honeybees

This chapter compares collective decisions in hives and in ant nests by relating the properties of recruiting signals to the foraging strategies displayed by these two insect societies. It describes the main positive and negative feedbacks that help foragers self-regulate their activities according to environmental constraints and opportunities. Even though honeybees and ants share a similar recruitment scenario, the nature of their recruiting signals, as well as the ways information about food patches is conveyed to nestmates, differ greatly. In honeybees, tactile signals rule many aspects of recruitment, whereas chemical communication is the backbone of collective foraging in ants. The chapter emphasizes the intimate link that relates the mode of locomotion of one species to the media chosen to communicate information about food resources. In particular, it demonstrates that the distinct properties of chemical and tactile signals match the environmental constraints faced either by ant individuals on the ground or by honeybees in the air. By referring to other group-living arthropods, the chapter addresses generic issues about information processing, its dissemination among conspecifics and the emergence of cooperative behavior.

本章通过将招募信号的特性与两种昆虫社群（蜂群和蚁巢）展现的觅食策略相关联，对比了它们的集体决策过程。文中描述了主要的正反馈和负反馈机制，这些机制帮助觅食者根据环境限制和机会自主调节自身活动。
尽管蜜蜂和蚂蚁的招募场景相似，但它们招募信号的本质以及向同伴传递食物源信息的方式存在显著差异。在蜜蜂中，触觉信号主导招募的多个方面；而化学通讯是蚂蚁集体觅食的核心。本章强调了物种的运动方式与其选择的食物资源信息传递媒介之间的密切联系。
具体而言，研究表明化学信号和触觉信号的独特特性，分别适配了地面活动的蚂蚁个体和空中活动的蜜蜂所面临的环境限制。通过参考其他群居节肢动物，本章探讨了信息处理、种内信息传播以及合作行为涌现等通用性问题。

The origin of nest complexity in social insects

an article

SOCIAL INSECTS: IMPRESSIVE ARCHITECTS AND BUILDERS
Among the great variety of collective activities performed by social insect societies
(all ants and termites, and some species of bees and wasps are social), building is
certainly the most spectacular, owing to the difference that exists between the
individual and collective levels [1-4]. This ability to build nests, some of which may be
extremely complex, remains a fascinating issue for naturalists and scientists. The origin of nest complexity remains an unsolved mystery. Few works exist that deal with the
analysis of the behavioral mechanisms involved in building and its regulation. Figure 1
shows some examples of nest architectures built by tropical wasps and African termites. Some species of wasps such as Chartergus (Figure 1a) or Epipona (Figure 1b)
build nests made of several stacked combs of cells, and the external walls of the most
peripheral cells are part of the external envelope of the nest. There is a central or peripheral communication opening that goes through the successive combs, allowing
the wasps to move from one floor to another. Some paper nests built by Polybia wasps
can be one meter high. In termites, some nests are literally cathedrals of clay that can
reach six or seven meters high in Macrotermes, that is, 600 times the size of a worker

社会性昆虫：令人赞叹的建筑师与建造者
在社会性昆虫群体（所有蚂蚁和白蚁，以及部分蜜蜂和黄蜂种类为社会性昆虫）所进行的各类集体活动中，建造行为无疑是最引人瞩目的。这源于其个体行为与集体成果之间存在巨大差异 [1-4]。这种建造巢穴的能力 —— 部分巢穴结构极为复杂 —— 一直是博物学家和科学家们痴迷的研究课题。巢穴复杂性的起源仍是未解之谜，目前针对建造行为涉及的行为机制及其调控方式的分析研究较少。
图 1 展示了热带黄蜂和非洲白蚁建造的部分巢穴结构实例。诸如 Chartergus 属（图 1a）或 Epipona 属（图 1b）的黄蜂种类，会建造由多层堆叠巢脾组成的巢穴，最外层巢室的外壁构成巢穴的外壳。巢穴设有贯穿各层巢脾的中央或周边通道开口，供黄蜂在不同 “楼层” 间移动。部分由 Polybia 属黄蜂建造的纸质巢穴高度可达一米。
而白蚁的部分巢穴堪称 “黏土大教堂”：Macrotermes 属白蚁的巢穴高度能达到六七米，相当于工蚁体长的 600 倍。

On self-organised aggregation dynamics in swarms of robots with informed robots

Aggregation is a process observed in natural systems whereby individuals gather together to form large cluster. Recent studies with cockroaches and robots have shown that relatively simple individual mechanisms can account for how individuals manage to gather on a single shelter when two or more are available in the environment. In this paper, we use simulated swarms of robots to further explore the aggregation dynamics generated by these simple individual mechanisms. Our objective is to study the introduction of “informed robots”, and to study how many of these are needed to direct the aggregation process towards a pre-defined site among those available in the environment. Informed robots are members of a group that selectively avoid the site/s where no aggregate should emerge and stop only on the experimenter pre-defined site/s for aggregation. We study the aggregation process with informed robots in three different scenarios: two that are morphologically symmetric, whereby the different types of aggregation site are equally represented in the environment; and an asymmetric scenario, whereby the target site has an area that is half the area of the sites that should be avoided. We first show what happens when no robot in the swarm is informed: in symmetric environments, the swarm is able to break the symmetry and aggregates on one of the two types of site at random, not necessarily on the target site, while in the asymmetric environment, the swarm tends to aggregate on the sites that are most represented in terms of area. The original contribution of this study is to demonstrate the effect of the introduction of a small proportion of informed robots in both environments: In symmetric environments, they selectively direct the aggregation process towards the experimenter chosen site; in the asymmetric environment, informed robots can invert the spontaneous preference for the most represented site and induce the swarm to aggregate on the least represented type of site. Moreover, for each scenario, we analyse how the dynamics of the aggregation process depends on the proportion of informed robots. As a further valuable contribution of this study, we provide analytical results by studying a system of ordinary differential equations that is an extension of a well-known model. Using this model, we show how, for certain values of the parameters, the model can predict the dynamics observed with simulated robots in one of the two symmetric scenarios.

聚集是自然系统中观察到的一种现象，即个体聚集形成大型集群。近期针对蟑螂和机器人的研究表明，相对简单的个体机制就能解释：当环境中存在两个或多个庇护所时，个体如何聚集到同一个庇护所。
本文通过仿真机器人群体，进一步探究这些简单个体机制产生的聚集动态。研究目标是引入 “知情机器人”，并探究需要多少此类机器人，才能将聚集过程引导至环境中多个可选位置中的预设目标位置。知情机器人是群体中的特殊成员，它们会选择性避开不应形成聚集的位置，仅在研究者预设的聚集位置停留。
我们在三种场景下研究含知情机器人的聚集过程：两种是形态对称场景，环境中不同类型的聚集位置数量均等；一种是不对称场景，目标位置的面积仅为应避开位置面积的一半。研究首先发现，当群体中无知情机器人时：对称环境下，群体能打破对称性，随机聚集到两种位置中的一种，不一定是目标位置；不对称环境下，群体倾向于聚集在面积占比更大的位置。
本研究的创新贡献在于，证实了在两种环境中引入少量知情机器人的效果：对称环境下，它们能选择性地将聚集过程引导至研究者选定的位置；不对称环境下，知情机器人可逆转群体对面积占比更大位置的自发偏好，促使群体聚集到面积占比更小的位置。此外，针对每个场景，我们分析了聚集动态如何依赖于知情机器人的比例。
本研究的另一重要贡献是，通过研究一个扩展自知名模型的常微分方程组，得出了解析结果。利用该模型，我们证明在特定参数值下，模型能预测其中一种对称场景中仿真机器人观察到的动态。

Collective decision with 100 Kilobots: Speed versus accuracy in binary discrimination problems

Achieving fast and accurate collective decisions with a large number of simple agents without relying on a central planning unit or on global communication is essential for developing complex collective behaviors. In this paper, we investigate the speed versus accuracy trade-off in collective decision-making in the context of a binary discrimination problem—i.e., how a swarm can collectively determine the best of two options. We describe a novel, fully distributed collective decision-making strategy that only requires agents with minimal capabilities and is faster than previous approaches. We evaluate our strategy experimentally, using a swarm of 100 Kilobots, and we study it theoretically, using both continuum and finite-size models. We find that the main factor affecting the speed versus accuracy trade-off of our strategy is the agents’ neighborhood size—i.e., the number of agents with whom the current opinion of each agent is shared. The proposed strategy and the associated theoretical framework can be used to design swarms that take collective decisions at a given level of speed and/or accuracy.

在不依赖中央规划单元或全局通信的情况下，让大量简单智能体快速且准确地做出集体决策，对于开发复杂集体行为至关重要。本文在二元判别问题背景下，探究集体决策中的速度与准确性权衡 —— 即群体如何集体判定两个选项中的最优项。
我们提出一种全新的完全分布式集体决策策略，该策略仅需具备最低能力的智能体，且比现有方法速度更快。通过 100 个 Kilobot 机器人组成的群体进行实验评估，并借助连续体模型和有限尺寸模型开展理论研究。
研究发现，影响该策略速度与准确性权衡的主要因素是智能体的邻域大小 —— 即每个智能体分享自身当前观点的对象数量。所提策略及相关理论框架可用于设计能在特定速度和 / 或准确性水平下做出集体决策的群体。

Adaptive leadership overcomes persistence--responsivity trade-off in flocking

The living world is full of cohesive collectives that have evolved to move together with high efficiency. Schools of fish or flocks of birds maintain their global direction despite significant noise perturbing the individuals, yet they are capable of performing abrupt collective turns when relevant agitation alters the state of a few members. Ruling local fluctuations out of global movement leads to persistence and requires overdamped interaction dynamics, while propagating swift turns throughout the group leads to responsivity and requires underdamped interaction dynamics. In this paper we show a way to avoid this conflict by introducing a time-dependent leadership hierarchy that adapts locally to will: agents’ intention of changing direction. Integrating our new concept of will-based inter-agent behaviour highly enhances the responsivity of standard collective motion models, thus enables breaking out of their former limit, the persistence-responsivity trade-off. We also show that the increased responsivity to environmental cues scales well with growing flock size. Our solution relies on active communication or advanced cognition for the perception of will. The incorporation of these into collective motion is a plausible hypothesis in higher order species, while it is a realizable feature for artificial robots, as demonstrated by our swarm of 52 drones.

生物界中存在大量紧密协作的群体，它们经进化具备高效协同移动的能力。鱼群或鸟群即便个体受到显著噪声干扰，仍能维持整体行进方向；而当少数成员因相关刺激改变状态时，群体又能迅速完成集体转向。
要排除局部波动对全局运动的影响以保持行进持续性，需要过阻尼相互作用动力学；而要让快速转向信号在群体中传播以实现响应性，则需要欠阻尼相互作用动力学。本文提出一种解决这一矛盾的方法：引入随时间变化的领导力层级，该层级可根据智能体的转向意图进行局部自适应调整。
将这种基于 “意图” 的智能体间交互新机制融入标准集体运动模型，能显著提升模型的响应性，从而突破此前存在的 “持续性 - 响应性权衡” 限制。研究还表明，群体对环境信号的响应性提升能力随群体规模扩大仍能良好适配。
我们的方案依赖主动通信或高级认知能力来感知 “意图”。对于高等生物而言，将这些能力融入集体运动是合理假设；而对于人工机器人，这一特性已可实现 —— 我们通过 52 架无人机组成的群体进行了验证。

Leader--follower flocking: algorithms and experiments

In this paper, we investigate a leader-follower flocking system where few members are group leaders who have global knowledge (a desired trajectory), while majority of the members are group followers who can communicate with neighbors but do not have global knowledge. The followers do not even know who the leaders are in the group. The flocking group is able to track a specific trajectory led by group leaders. In this system, all group members estimate the position of flocking center by using a consensus algorithm via local communication in order to keep the flocking group connected. Based on the estimated position of flocking center, a leader-follower flocking algorithm is proposed, and its stability is proved. A group of real robots ldquowifibotsrdquo are used to test the feasibility of the algorithm. Experiments show that this leader-follower flocking system can track the desired trajectory led by group leaders.

本文研究一种 leader-follower（领航 - 跟随）集群系统：少数成员为具备全局知识（已知期望轨迹）的领航者，多数成员为仅能与邻居通信、无全局知识的跟随者，且跟随者无需知晓群体中领航者的身份。该集群能在领航者引导下跟踪特定轨迹。
在该系统中，所有成员通过局部通信的一致性算法估计集群中心位置，以维持集群的连通性。基于估计的集群中心位置，本文提出一种领航 - 跟随集群算法，并证明了其稳定性。通过一组真实的 “wifi 机器人” 验证了该算法的可行性，实验结果表明，该领航 - 跟随集群系统能够在领航者引导下跟踪期望轨迹。

amraii2014explicit
Explicit vs. tacit leadership in influencing the behavior of swarms

Many researchers have employed some form of teleoperated leader to influence a robotic swarm; however, the way in which this influence is conveyed has not been well studied. Some researchers employ designated leaders that are known to be leaders by other members of the swarm and hence followed. Others do not impose a leader/follower distinction on the swarm's algorithms and instead choose to influence the swarm indirectly through controlling one or more of its members. Because the robustness of swarm behavior arises from its many distributed interactions, influence through designated leaders might render it susceptible to noise or disrupt its coherence by overriding these mechanisms. Conversely, limiting human influence to indirect control through the local effects of a leader might prove too sluggish to allow effective human control. This paper compares leader-based methods of each type, designated as Tacit leadership via consensus (no explicit leader/follower distinction) and Explicit leadership via flooding (influence propagating from leader takes precedence). These methods were compared in simulation and in human experiments finding that explicit leadership led to faster convergence in simulation and better performance in the experiments. Effects of noise were slightly more pronounced for Explicit leaders and cohesion slightly poorer.

许多研究者采用某种形式的遥控领航者来影响机器人群体，但这种影响的传递方式尚未得到充分研究。部分研究者采用 “指定领航者” 模式，群体其他成员明确知晓其领航者身份并予以跟随；另一些研究者则不在群体算法中划分领航者与跟随者，而是通过控制群体中一个或多个成员，间接对群体施加影响。
由于群体行为的稳健性源于大量分布式交互，通过指定领航者施加影响可能会因覆盖这些固有机制，导致群体易受噪声干扰或破坏其连贯性；反之，仅通过领航者的局部作用进行间接人工控制，又可能因响应过于迟缓而无法实现有效的人工操控。
本文对比了两种基于领航者的控制方法：一种是 “基于一致性的隐性领航”（无明确领航者 / 跟随者划分），另一种是 “基于扩散的显性领航”（领航者的影响传播具有优先性）。通过仿真和人体实验对两种方法进行对比，结果表明：显性领航在仿真中收敛速度更快，在实验中表现更优；但显性领航受噪声影响略为显著，且群体凝聚力稍差。

An adversarial approach to private flocking in mobile robot teams

Privacy is an important facet of defence against adversaries. In this letter, we introduce the problem of private flocking. We consider a team of mobile robots flocking in the presence of an adversary, who is able to observe all robots' trajectories, and who is interested in identifying the leader. We present a method that generates private flocking controllers that hide the identity of the leader robot. Our approach towards privacy leverages a data-driven adversarial co-optimization scheme. We design a mechanism that optimizes flocking control parameters, such that leader inference is hindered. As the flocking performance improves, we successively train an adversarial discriminator that tries to infer the identity of the leader robot. To evaluate the performance of our co-optimization scheme, we investigate different classes of reference trajectories. Although it is reasonable to assume that there is an inherent trade-off between flocking performance and privacy, our results demonstrate that we are able to achieve high flocking performance and simultaneously reduce the risk of revealing the leader.

隐私是抵御攻击者的重要保障。本文提出 “隐私集群” 问题：考虑一队移动机器人在存在攻击者的环境中集群移动，攻击者能够观测所有机器人的轨迹，并意图识别出领航者。
我们提出一种生成隐私集群控制器的方法，该控制器可隐藏领航机器人的身份。隐私保护方案基于数据驱动的对抗性协同优化框架，通过设计机制优化集群控制参数，阻碍对领航者的推断。随着集群性能的提升，我们持续训练一个对抗性判别器，该判别器试图推断领航机器人的身份。
为评估协同优化框架的性能，我们研究了不同类型的参考轨迹。尽管集群性能与隐私保护之间存在固有的权衡是合理假设，但实验结果表明，我们能够在实现高集群性能的同时，降低领航者身份泄露的风险。

Collective decision making in swarm robotics with distributed Bayesian hypothesis testing

In this paper, we propose Distributed Bayesian Hypothesis Testing (DBHT) as a novel collective decision-making strategy to solve the collective perception problem. We experimented with different sampling and dissemination intervals for DBHT and concluded that the selection of both intervals presents a trade-off between speed and accuracy. After that, we compare the performance of DBHT in simulation with that of 3 other commonly used collective decision-making strategies, DVMD, DMMD and DC. We tested them on collective perception problems with different difficulties and feature patterns. We have concluded that DBHT outperforms considered existing algorithms significantly in collective perception tasks with high difficulty, namely close proportion of features and clustered feature distribution.

本文提出分布式贝叶斯假设检验（DBHT）作为一种新型集体决策策略，用于解决集体感知问题。我们针对 DBHT 的不同采样间隔和传播间隔进行实验，得出结论：这两种间隔的选择需在速度与准确性之间进行权衡。
之后，我们在仿真环境中将 DBHT 与另外三种常用集体决策策略（DVMD、DMMD 和 DC）的性能进行对比，并在不同难度和特征模式的集体感知问题上展开测试。结果表明，在高难度集体感知任务中 —— 即特征占比接近且特征呈聚集分布的场景 ——DBHT 的性能显著优于所对比的现有算法。

Innate motivation for robot swarms by minimizing surprise: From simple simulations to real-world experiments

Applications of large-scale mobile multirobot systems can be beneficial over monolithic robots because of higher potential for robustness and scalability. Developing controllers for multirobot systems is challenging because the multitude of interactions is hard to anticipate and difficult to model. Automatic design using machine learning or evolutionary robotics seem to be options to avoid that challenge, but bring the challenge of designing reward or fitness functions. Generic reward and fitness functions seem unlikely to exist and task-specific rewards often have undesired side effects. Approaches of so-called innate motivation try to avoid the specific formulation of rewards and work instead with different drivers, such as curiosity. Our approach to innate motivation is to minimize surprise, which we implement by maximizing the accuracy of the swarm robot’s sensor predictions using neuroevolution. A unique advantage of the swarm robot case is that swarm members populate the robot’s environment and can trigger more active behaviors in a self-referential loop. In this article, we summarize our previous simulation-based results concerning behavioral diversity, robustness, scalability, and engineered self-organization, and put them into context. In several new studies, we analyze the influence of the optimizer’s hyperparameters, the scalability of evolved behaviors, and the impact of realistic robot simulations. Finally, we present results using real robots that show how the reality gap can be bridged.

大规模移动多机器人系统的应用相比单体机器人更具优势，因其在稳健性和可扩展性方面潜力更高。为多机器人系统开发控制器极具挑战性，原因是大量交互难以预测且建模困难。
借助机器学习或进化机器人学的自动设计方法似乎能规避这一挑战，但会带来设计奖励函数或适应度函数的新难题。通用奖励函数和适应度函数几乎不存在，而任务特定奖励函数往往会产生不良副作用。所谓的内在动机方法试图避免奖励的特定表述，转而利用好奇心等不同驱动因素。我们的内在动机方法旨在最小化意外性，具体通过神经进化最大化群体机器人传感器预测的准确性来实现。群体机器人场景的独特优势在于，群体成员本身构成机器人的环境，能通过自指循环触发更主动的行为。
本文总结了我们此前基于仿真的研究结果，涉及行为多样性、稳健性、可扩展性和工程化自组织，并阐述其相关背景。在多项新研究中，我们分析了优化器超参数的影响、进化行为的可扩展性，以及真实机器人仿真的作用。最后，我们展示了基于真实机器人的实验结果，验证了如何弥合仿真与现实之间的差距。

Cucker--Smale flocking under hierarchical leadership and random interactions

Consider a flock of birds that fly interacting between them. This flock is a hierarchical system in which each bird, at each time step, adjusts its own velocity according to its past velocity and a linear combination of the relative velocities of its superiors in the hierarchy. This linear combination has nonnegative random coefficients, including the case in which each of the birds can fail to see any of its superiors with certain probability. For this model with random interactions we prove that the flocking results, obtained for similar deterministic models, hold true.

试想一群相互作用、协同飞行的鸟群。该鸟群是一个层级系统，每只鸟在每个时间步长内，都会根据自身过往速度，以及层级中上级个体相对速度的线性组合来调整自身速度。
这种线性组合具有非负随机系数，包括每只鸟都有可能以特定概率无法观测到任何上级个体的情况。针对这一随机交互模型，我们证明：在类似确定性模型中得出的集群结论，同样适用于该随机模型。

Flocking estimates for the Cucker--Smale model with time lag and hierarchical leadership

We analyze the Cucker–Smale model under hierarchical leadership in presence of a time delay. By using a Lyapunov functional approach and some induction arguments we will prove convergence to consensus for every positive delay τ. We also prove a flocking estimate in the case of a free-will leader. These results seem to point out the advantage of a hierarchical structure in order to contrast time delay effects that frequently appear in real situations.

我们分析了存在时滞的层级领航下的卡克 - 斯梅尔（Cucker–Smale）模型。通过李雅普诺夫泛函方法和归纳法论证，我们证明了对于任意正延迟 τ，系统均能收敛至一致性状态。
我们还针对自主领航者场景，得出了集群估计结果。这些结果表明，层级结构在抵消实际场景中频繁出现的时滞效应方面具有显著优势。

jia2019modelling
Modelling hierarchical flocking

We present a general framework for modeling a wide selection of flocking scenarios under free boundary conditions. Several variants have been considered—including examples for the widely observed behavior of hierarchically interacting units. The models we have simulated correspond to classes of various realistic situations. Our primary goal was to investigate the stability of a flock in the presence of noise. Some of our findings are counter-intuitive in the first approximation, e.g. if the hierarchy is based purely on dominance (an uneven contribution of the neighbors to the decision about the direction of flight of a given individual) the flock is more prone to loose coherence due to perturbations even when a comparison with the standard egalitarian flock is made. Thus, we concentrated on building models based on leader-follower relationships. And, indeed, our findings support the concept that hierarchical organization can be very efficient in important practical cases, especially if the leader-follower interactions (corresponding to an underlying directed network of interactions) have several levels. Efficiency here is associated with remaining stable (coherent and cohesive) even in cases when collective motion is destroyed by random perturbations. The framework we present allows allows the study of several further complex interactions among the members of flocking agents.

我们提出一种通用框架，用于建模自由边界条件下的多种集群场景。该框架涵盖了多种变体，包括广泛观察到的层级交互单元行为实例。我们仿真的模型对应各类贴合实际的场景，核心目标是探究噪声环境下集群的稳定性。
部分研究结果初看与直觉相悖：例如，若层级仅基于优势地位（邻居对个体飞行方向决策的贡献不均等），即便与标准平等型集群相比，该集群在受到扰动时也更易丧失连贯性。因此，我们重点构建了基于领航 - 跟随关系的模型。
研究结果确实支持以下观点：在重要实际场景中，层级结构可具备极高效率，尤其是当领航 - 跟随交互（对应底层有向交互网络）存在多个层级时。这里的效率体现为，即便集体运动受到随机扰动破坏，集群仍能保持稳定（连贯且凝聚）。我们提出的框架还可用于研究集群智能体成员间更多复杂的交互关系。

Photomorphogenesis for robot self-assembly: adaptivity, collective decision-making, and self-repair

Self-assembly in biology is an inspiration for engineered large-scale multi-modular systems with desirable characteristics, such as robustness, scalability, and adaptivity. Previous works have shown that simple mobile robots can be used to emulate and study self-assembly behaviors. However, many of these studies were restricted to rather static and inflexible aggregations in predefined shapes, and were limited in adaptivity compared to that observed in nature. We propose a photomorphogenesis approach for robots using our vascular morphogenesis model—a light-stimuli directed method for multi-robot self-assembly inspired by the tissue growth of trees. Robots in the role of ‘leaves’ collect a virtual resource that is proportional to a real, sensed environmental feature. This is then used to build a virtual underlying network that shares a common resource throughout the whole robot aggregate and determines where it grows or shrinks as a reaction to the dynamic environment. In our approach the robots use supplemental bioinspired models to collectively select a leading robot to decide who starts to self-assemble (and where), or to assemble static aggregations. The robots then use our vascular morphogenesis model to aggregate in a directed way preferring bright areas, hence resembling natural phototropism (growth towards light). Our main result is that the assembled robots are adaptive and able to react to dynamic environments by collectively and autonomously rearranging the aggregate, discarding outdated parts, and growing new ones. In representative experiments, the self-assembling robots collectively make rational decisions on where to grow. Cutting off parts of the aggregate triggers a self-organizing repair process in the robots, and the parts regrow. All these capabilities of adaptivity, collective decision-making, and self-repair in our robot self-assembly originate directly from self-organized behavior of the vascular morphogenesis model. Our approach opens up opportunities for self-assembly with reconfiguration on short time-scales with high adaptivity of dynamic forms and structures.

生物学中的自组装现象，为设计具备稳健性、可扩展性和适应性等优良特性的工程化大规模多模块系统提供了灵感。此前研究表明，简单移动机器人可用于模拟和研究自组装行为，但这些研究大多局限于在预定义形状下形成相对静态、缺乏灵活性的聚集结构，且与自然界观察到的自组装相比，适应性较弱。
我们提出一种机器人光形态发生方法，该方法基于血管形态发生模型 —— 这是一种受树木组织生长启发、由光刺激引导的多机器人自组装方式。扮演 “叶片” 角色的机器人收集虚拟资源，该资源与感知到的真实环境特征成比例。这些虚拟资源会用于构建虚拟底层网络，该网络在整个机器人聚集结构中共享公共资源，并根据动态环境的变化，决定聚集结构的生长或收缩位置。
在我们的方法中，机器人借助补充的生物启发模型，集体选择一个领航机器人，由其决定自组装的启动者（及启动位置），或完成静态聚集。随后，机器人利用血管形态发生模型进行定向聚集，优先向明亮区域聚集，这与自然界的向光性（向光生长）相似。
核心研究结果显示，组装后的机器人具备适应性，能够通过集体自主重新排列聚集结构、舍弃过时部分并生长新部分，来响应动态环境。在代表性实验中，自组装机器人能集体理性决策生长位置；切断聚集结构的部分区域后，机器人会启动自组织修复过程，实现受损部分的再生。
我们的机器人自组装所具备的适应性、集体决策和自我修复能力，均直接源于血管形态发生模型的自组织行为。该方法为实现短时间尺度内的自组装重构提供了可能，有望获得具备高适应性的动态形态和结构。

Swarm of micro flying robots in the wild

Aerial robots are widely deployed, but highly cluttered environments such as dense forests remain inaccessible to drones and even more so to swarms of drones. In these scenarios, previously unknown surroundings and narrow corridors combined with requirements of swarm coordination can create challenges. To enable swarm navigation in the wild, we develop miniature but fully autonomous drones with a trajectory planner that can function in a timely and accurate manner based on limited information from onboard sensors. The planning problem satisfies various task requirements including flight efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and inter-robot collision avoidance, dynamical feasibility, swarm coordination, and so on, thus realizing an extensible planner. Furthermore, the proposed planner deforms trajectory shapes and adjusts time allocation synchronously based on spatial-temporal joint optimization. A high-quality trajectory thus can be obtained after exhaustively exploiting the solution space within only a few milliseconds, even in the most constrained environment. The planner is finally integrated into the developed palm-sized swarm platform with onboard perception, localization, and control. Benchmark comparisons validate the superior performance of the planner in trajectory quality and computing time. Various real-world field experiments demonstrate the extensibility of our system. Our approach evolves aerial robotics in three aspects: capability of cluttered environment navigation, extensibility to diverse task requirements, and coordination as a swarm without external facilities.

空中机器人应用广泛，但茂密森林等高度复杂环境仍难以被无人机（尤其是无人机集群）触及。这类场景中，未知环境、狭窄通道与集群协同需求相结合，会带来诸多挑战。
为实现野外集群导航，我们研发了微型全自主无人机，并设计了轨迹规划器。该规划器仅依赖机载传感器的有限信息，就能及时、准确地工作。规划问题需满足飞行效率、避障、机器人间防撞、动态可行性、集群协同等多种任务需求，由此实现了一种可扩展的规划器。
此外，所提规划器基于时空联合优化，同步调整轨迹形状和时间分配。即便在最受限的环境中，也能在数毫秒内充分探索解空间，得到高质量轨迹。最终，该规划器被集成到自主研发的掌心大小集群平台中，具备机载感知、定位和控制能力。
基准测试对比验证了该规划器在轨迹质量和计算时间上的优越性能，多项真实野外实验证明了系统的可扩展性。我们的方法从三个方面推动了空中机器人技术的发展：复杂环境导航能力、对多样化任务需求的可扩展性，以及无需外部设施的集群协同能力。

Fast mutual relative localization of uavs using ultraviolet led markers

This paper proposes a new methodology for outdoor mutual relative localization of UAVs equipped with active ultraviolet markers and a suitable camera with specialized bandpass filters. Mutual relative localization is a crucial tool for formation preservation, swarming and cooperative task completion in scenarios in which UAVs share working space in small relative distances. In most current systems of compact UAV swarms the localization of particular UAVs is based on the data obtained from motion capture systems for indoor experiments or on precise RTK-GNSS data outdoor. Such an external infrastructure is unavailable in most of real multi-UAV applications and often cannot be pre-installed. To account for such situations, as well as to make the system more autonomous, reliance on onboard sensors only is desirable. In the proposed approach, we rely on ultraviolet LED markers, that emit light in frequencies that are less common in nature than the visible light or infrared radiation, especially in high intensities. Additionally, common camera sensors are sensitive to ultraviolet light, making the addition of a filter the only necessary modification, keeping the platform low-cost, which is one of the key requirements on swarm systems. This also allows for a smaller size of the markers to be sufficient, without burdening the processing resources. Thus the proposed system aspires to be an enabling technology for deployment of large swarms of possibly micro-scale aerial vehicles in real world conditions and without any dependency on an external infrastructure.

本文提出一种新方法，用于搭载主动紫外标记和配备专用带通滤波器相机的无人机（UAV）室外互相对位。互相对位是无人机在近距离共享工作空间场景下，维持编队、集群运动及完成协同任务的关键技术。
目前多数紧凑型无人机集群系统中，单架无人机的定位室内依赖运动捕捉系统数据，室外依赖精密 RTK-GNSS 数据。而多数实际多无人机应用场景中，此类外部基础设施不可用且往往无法预先安装。为应对这类情况并提升系统自主性，仅依靠机载传感器的定位方案更为理想。
所提方法采用紫外 LED 标记，其发射的光频率（尤其是高强度光）在自然界中比可见光或红外辐射更为罕见。此外，普通相机传感器对紫外光敏感，仅需添加滤波器即可适配，无需额外复杂改装，保持了平台的低成本特性 —— 这是集群系统的核心要求之一。这也使得标记尺寸可进一步缩小且能满足使用需求，同时不占用过多处理资源。
因此，该系统有望成为一项关键支撑技术，助力大规模（甚至微型）无人机集群在真实环境中部署，且无需依赖任何外部基础设施。

Towards fast fiducial marker with full 6 dof pose estimation

This paper proposes a new method for the full 6 degrees of freedom pose estimation of a circular fiducial marker. This circular black-and-white planar marker provides a unique and versatile identification of individual markers while maintaining a real-time detection. Such a marker and the vision localisation system based on it is suitable for both external and self-localisation. Together with an off-the-shelf camera, the marker aims to provide a sufficient pose estimation accuracy to substitute the current high-end localisation systems. In order to assess the performance of our proposed marker system, we evaluate its capabilities against the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of their ability to estimate the 2D and 3D positions. For such purpose, a real-world dataset, inspired by typical applications in mobile and swarm robotics, was collected as the performance under the real conditions provides better insights into the method's potential than an artificially simulated environment. The experiments performed show that the method presented here achieved three times the accuracy of the marker it was derived from.

结合现成相机，该标记旨在提供足够的位姿估计精度，以替代当前的高端定位系统。为评估所提标记系统的性能，我们将其与现有最先进方法在 2D 和 3D 位置估计能力方面进行对比。
为此，我们采集了一个真实世界数据集，该数据集灵感来源于移动机器人和群体机器人的典型应用场景 —— 因为真实环境下的性能表现，比人工模拟环境更能反映方法的实际潜力。实验结果表明，本文提出的方法，其精度达到了所衍生基准标记的三倍。

A passivity-based approach to formation control using partial measurements of relative position

In this technical note, we present a framework for the formation control of dynamic vehicles in R3, using partial measurements of relative position. The proposed control scheme implements virtual mechanical couplings on the available sensor measurements, and is developed using a passivity-based design approach with considerable insight from the bondgraph modelling formalism. In particular, we present a novel passive adaptive compensation technique to estimate the unknown state information required for the key cases of range and bearing measurements. We show that the proposed architecture is locally asymptotically stable to a desired formation. The performance of the proposed controller is verified by a simulation study.

具体而言，针对距离和方位测量这两种关键场景，我们提出一种新型无源自适应补偿技术，用于估计所需的未知状态信息。研究表明，该控制架构对期望编队具有局部渐近稳定性。通过仿真研究，验证了所提控制器的性能。

Control of changes in formation for a team of mobile robots

Addresses the control of a team of robots navigating in a terrain with obstacles while maintaining a desired formation and changing formations when required. We model the team as a triple consisting of a group element that describes the gross motion of the team, a set of shape variables that describe the relative positions of robots, and a control graph that describes the behaviors of the robots in the formation. We assume that a lead robot is equipped with the appropriate sensors and plans the gross motion (path) for the team. This path is derived from optimal control theory. All other robots are coordinated by continuous controllers that are prescribed by the control graph. Our framework allows us to enumerate the number of control graphs and the possible transitions between them. Further, we describe an algorithm that allows the team of robots to move between any two formations, while avoiding obstacles. We illustrate the methodology with examples involving teams of 5 and 6 robots in the presence of obstacles.

Fast formation of swarm of UAVs in congested urban environment

As Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) become more readily available and reduce in cost, using multiple UAVs simultaneously to accomplish a task becomes increasingly attractive. Once swarms of UAVs share the same workspace (operational environment) it is necessary to have a means to rapidly adopt an optimal collision-free formation in the workspace. A popular approach for formation of an optimal swarm is to use Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques. A variant of PSO was recently introduced called nPSO which claims to exhibit more rapid convergence than other variants. In this paper nPSO is applied to the problem of finding optimal positions of UAVs forming a swarm in presence of large obstacles such as buildings in an urban environment. The experiments show that no more than 1000 iterations are required to obtain near optimal formation of swarm of UAVs for different maps, including maps relating to congested environments.

随着无人机（UAV）的普及度提升且成本降低，同时使用多架无人机完成任务的方式愈发具有吸引力。当无人机集群共享同一工作空间（作业环境）时，需要一种能在该空间内快速形成最优无碰撞编队的方法。
粒子群优化（PSO）技术是实现集群最优编队的常用方法。近期提出的一种 PSO 变体 ——nPSO，据称比其他变体收敛速度更快。本文将 nPSO 应用于城市环境中存在建筑物等大型障碍物的场景，求解无人机集群的最优编队位置问题。
实验结果表明，针对不同地图（包括拥挤环境相关地图），无人机集群获得近最优编队所需迭代次数均不超过 1000 次。

Towards a swarm of agile micro quadrotors

We describe a prototype 75 g micro quadrotor with onboard attitude estimation and control that operates autonomously with an external localization system. The motivation for designing quadrotors at this scale comes from two observations. First, the agility of the robot increases with a reduction in size, a fact that is supported by experimental results in this paper. Second, smaller robots are able to operate in tight formations in constrained, indoor environments. We describe the hardware and software used to operate the vehicle as well our dynamic model. We also discuss the aerodynamics of vertical flight and the contribution of ground effect to the vehicle performance. Finally, we discuss architecture and algorithms to coordinate a team of these quadrotors, and provide experimental results for a team of 20 micro quadrotors.

Growing super stable tensegrity frameworks

This paper discusses methods for growing tensegrity frameworks akin to what are now known as Henneberg constructions (HCs), which apply to bar-joint frameworks. In particular, this paper presents tensegrity framework versions of the three key HCs of vertex addition, edge splitting, and framework merging (where separate frameworks are combined into a larger framework). This is done for super stable tensegrity frameworks in an ambient 2-D or 3-D space. We start with the operation of adding a new vertex to an original super stable tensegrity framework, named vertex addition. We prove that the new tensegrity framework can be super stable as well if the new vertex is attached to the original framework by an appropriate number of members, which include struts or cables, with suitably assigned stresses. Edge splitting can be secured in R2 (R3) by adding a vertex joined to three (four) existing vertices, two of which are connected by a member, and then removing that member. This procedure, with appropriate selection of struts or cables, preserves super-stability. In d-dimensional ambient space, merging two super stable frameworks sharing at least d+1 vertices that are in general positions, we show that the resulting tensegrity framework is still super stable. Based on these results, we further investigate the strategies of merging two super stable tensegrity frameworks in Rd, (d ∈ {2, 3}) that share fewer than d+1 vertices, and show how they may be merged through the insertion of struts or cables as appropriate between the two structures, with a super stable structure resulting from the merge.

本文探讨类亨内贝格构造（HCs）的张拉整体结构生成方法，这类构造原本适用于杆 - 节点结构。具体而言，本文提出张拉整体结构版本的三种核心亨内贝格构造：顶点添加、边拆分和结构合并（即将多个独立结构组合为更大结构），研究对象为二维或三维空间中的超稳定张拉整体结构。
顶点添加操作
从原始超稳定张拉整体结构中添加新顶点的操作为顶点添加。研究证明，若新顶点通过适量杆件（包括压杆或拉索）与原始结构连接，并分配合适的预应力，生成的新张拉整体结构仍可保持超稳定性。
边拆分操作
在二维（三维）空间中，边拆分可通过以下方式实现：添加一个新顶点，使其与三个（四个）现有顶点相连（其中两个顶点间原有一根杆件），随后移除该原有杆件。通过合理选择压杆或拉索，该操作可保持结构的超稳定性。
结构合并操作
在 d 维空间中，若两个超稳定结构共享至少 d+1 个处于一般位置的顶点，合并后的张拉整体结构仍具有超稳定性。基于这一结果，本文进一步研究二维和三维空间中共享顶点数少于 d+1 的两个超稳定张拉整体结构的合并策略，提出通过在两个结构间适当插入压杆或拉索，可使合并后的结构保持超稳定性。

Finite-time rigidity-based formation maneuvering of multiagent systems using distributed finite-time velocity estimators

In this paper, finite time rigidity-based formation maneuvering control of single integrator multiagent systems is considered. The target formation graph is assumed to be minimally and infinitesimally rigid, and the desired group velocity is considered to be available only to a subset of the agents. A distributed nonsmooth velocity estimator is used for each agent to estimate the desired group velocity in finite time. Using Lyapunov and input to state stability notions, a finite time distance-based formation maneuvering controller is presented and it is proved that by using the controller, agents converge to the target formation and track the desired group velocity in finite time. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the designed controller is implementable in local coordinate frames of the agents. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

A rigidity-based decentralized bearing formation controller for groups of quadrotor UAVs

This paper considers the problem of controlling a formation of quadrotor UAVs equipped with onboard cameras able to measure relative bearings in their local body frames w.r.t. neighboring UAVs. The control goal is twofold: (i) steering the agent group towards a formation defined in terms of desired bearings, and (ii) actuating the group motions in the ‘null-space’ of the current bearing formation. The proposed control strategy relies on an extension of the rigidity theory to the case of directed bearing frameworks in ℝ3×S1. This extension allows to devise a decentralized bearing controller which, unlike most of the present literature, does not need presence of a common reference frame or of reciprocal bearing measurements for the agents. Simulation and experimental results are then presented for illustrating and validating the approach.

Translational and scaling formation maneuver control via a bearing-based approach

This paper studies distributed maneuver control of multiagent formations in arbitrary dimensions. The objective is to control the translation and scale of the formation while maintaining the desired formation pattern. Unlike conventional approaches where the target formation is defined by relative positions or distances, we propose a novel bearing-based approach where the target formation is defined by inter-neighbor bearings. Since the bearings are invariant to the translation and scale of the formation, the bearing-based approach provides a simple solution to the problem of translational and scaling formation maneuver control. Linear formation control laws for double-integrator dynamics are proposed and the global formation stability is analyzed. This paper also studies bearing-based formation control in the presence of practical problems, including input disturbances, acceleration saturation, and collision avoidance. The theoretical results are illustrated with numerical simulations.

Bearing rigidity and almost global bearing-only formation stabilization

A fundamental problem that the bearing rigidity theory studies is to determine when a framework can be uniquely determined up to a translation and a scaling factor by its inter-neighbor bearings. While many previous works focused on the bearing rigidity of two-dimensional frameworks, a first contribution of this paper is to extend these results to arbitrary dimensions. It is shown that a framework in an arbitrary dimension can be uniquely determined up to a translation and a scaling factor by the bearings if and only if the framework is infinitesimally bearing rigid. In this paper, the proposed bearing rigidity theory is further applied to the bearing-only formation stabilization problem where the target formation is defined by inter-neighbor bearings and the feedback control uses only bearing measurements. Nonlinear distributed bearing-only formation control laws are proposed for the cases with and without a global orientation. It is proved that the control laws can almost globally stabilize infinitesimally bearing rigid formations. Numerical simulations are provided to support the analysis.

Adaptive formation control of networked robotic systems with bearing-only measurements

In this article, we address the bearing-only formation control problem of 3-D networked robotic systems with parametric uncertainties. The contributions of this article are two-fold: 1) the bearing-rigid theory is extended to solve the nonlinear robotic systems with the Euler–Lagrange-like model and 2) a novel almost global stable distributed bearing-only formation control law is proposed for the nonlinear robotic systems. Specifically, the robotic systems subject to nonholonomic constraints and dynamics are first transformed into a Euler–Lagrange-like model. By exploring the bearing-rigid graph theory, a backstepping approach is used to design the distributed formation controller. Simulations for 3-D robotics are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control law. Compared to the distance-rigid formation control approach, the bearing-rigid approach guarantees almost global stability while naturally excluding flip ambiguities.

Adaptive bearing-only formation tracking control for nonholonomic multiagent systems

In this article, we consider the formation tracking problem of nonholonomic multiagent systems only using relative bearing measurements between the agents. Such a practical and important yet challenging issue has been taken into limited consideration by existing approaches, which usually requires additional measurements such as relative positions. The contributions of this article are two-fold. First, a fully distributed reference velocity estimator is proposed. Under the proposed adaptive estimator, each agent can estimate the time-varying reference velocity asymptotically. Second, an input-to-state stable controller is designed according to the bearing rigid theory. Under the proposed controller, the formation with bearing-only constraints can be achieved. Finally, the proposed scheme is demonstrated and its effectiveness is verified by presenting some simulation and experimental tests.

Bearing-only formation control with prespecified convergence time

This article considers the bearing-only formation control problem, where the control of each agent only relies on relative bearings of their neighbors. A new control law is proposed to achieve target formations in finite time. Different from the existing results, the control law is based on a time-varying scaling gain. Hence, the convergence time can be arbitrarily chosen by users, and the derivative of the control input is continuous. Furthermore, sufficient conditions are given to guarantee almost global convergence and interagent collision avoidance. Then, a leader–follower control structure is proposed to achieve global convergence. By exploring the properties of the bearing Laplacian matrix, the collision avoidance and smooth control input are preserved. A multirobot hardware platform is designed to validate the theoretical results. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design.

Finite-time cooperative control for bearing-defined leader-following formation of multiple double-integrators

In this article, the finite-time cooperative control problem for leader-following bearing-defined formation tracking of multiagent systems with double-integrator dynamics is investigated. Different from the existing works on finite-time containment control, our objective is to make followers track leaders’ trajectories and form a shape-preserving formation rather than a convex hull. The target formation is defined by both leaders’ motions and bearing constraints among neighboring agents, which enables the formation not only to form and preserve a geometric pattern but also to have the ability to achieve both translational and scaling formation maneuver. To satisfy the bearing constraints, a matrix-weighted estimator/controller is developed. The finite-time stabilization of the target formation is achieved, though the matrix-weighted design makes the stability analysis complicated. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness.

Distributed bearing-based formation control of unmanned aerial vehicle swarm via global orientation estimation

Most existing formation control approaches for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm assume that global position and global coordinate frame are directly available for each agent. To extend the application domain, this paper proposes a distributed bearing-based formation control scheme, without any reliance on global position or global coordinate frame. The interactions among UAVs are described by a directed topology with two-leader structure. To address the issue of unavailable global coordinate frame, we first present a distributed orientation estimation law for each UAV to determine its orientation under the coordinate frame of the first leader. Based on the orientation estimation, we then design a bearing-based formation control law to globally asymptotically track target moving formations. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the proposed method, which show that the translation, scale and orientation of the formation can be flexibly controlled via two leaders.

Bearing-based formation control for multiple underactuated autonomous surface vehicles with flexible size scaling

Most existing formation control approaches for Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) focused on achieving rigid patterns with invariant inter-vehicle distance in open ocean environment. However, these methods cannot be applied to the cooperative missions on irregular inland waterway with changing width (such as rivers, canals and fjords), wherein the inter-vehicle distance should be continuously adjustable to respond to the environment dynamically. This paper proposes a bearing-based formation scaling control scheme for underactuated ASVs to achieve the desired patterns but with a flexible size scaling. By assuming that the fleet satisfies a leader–first-follower structure, the formation scaling parameters are accessible only to leaders, while each follower needs to maintain the bearing constraints to its neighboring ASVs without any knowledge of scale information. We respectively design distributed control laws for leaders and follower, and adaptive neural networks (NNs) are incorporated to approximate the dynamic uncertainties induced by parameter perturbations, external disturbances and input saturations. To improve the tracking performance, an auxiliary adaptive law is resorted to compensate the non-zero estimation error of NNs. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the closed-loop scaling maneuver tracking and formation tracking errors converge to zero asymptotically. The comparative simulation results are presented to substantiate the effectiveness of the designed control method.

现有多数自主水面航行器（ASVs）编队控制方法聚焦于在开阔海洋环境中实现舰间距离固定的刚性构型。但这些方法无法应用于宽度变化的不规则内陆水道（如河流、运河和峡湾）协同任务，这类场景中舰间距离需动态调整以适应环境变化。本文提出一种基于方位角的欠驱动自主水面航行器编队缩放控制方案，可实现期望构型且尺寸缩放灵活。
系统结构假设
假设航行器编队采用领航 - 首跟随者结构，编队缩放参数仅对领航者可知，每个跟随者无需了解缩放信息，只需维持与相邻航行器的方位角约束。

Bearing-based network localizability: A unifying view

This paper provides a unifying view and offers new insights on bearing-based network localizability, that is the problem of establishing whether a set of directions between pairs of nodes uniquely determines (up to translation and scale) the position of the nodes in d-space. If nodes represent cameras then we are in the context of global structure from motion. The contribution of the paper is theoretical: first, we rewrite and link in a coherent structure several results that have been presented in different communities using disparate formalisms; second, we derive some new localizability results within the edge-based formulation.

Finite-time bearing-based maneuver of acyclic leader-follower formations

This letter proposes two finite-time bearing-based control laws for acyclic leader-follower formations. The leaders in formation move with a bounded continuous reference velocity and each follower controls its position with regard to three agents in the formation. The first control law uses only bearing vectors, and finite-time convergence is achieved by properly selecting two state-dependent control gains. The second control law requires both bearing vectors and communications between agents. Each agent simultaneously localizes and follows a virtual target. Finite-time convergence of the desired formation under both control laws is proved by mathematical induction and supported by numerical simulations.

第二种控制律既需要方位向量，也需要智能体间的通信，每个智能体同时定位并跟踪虚拟目标。

Formation shape control based on bearing rigidity

Distance measurements are not the only geometric quantities that can be used for multi-agent formation shape control. Bearing measurements can be used in conjunction with distances. This article employs bearing rigidity for mobile formations, which was developed for robot and sensor network localisation, so that bearings can be used for shape control in mobile formations. The first part of this article examines graph theoretical models for formation network analysis and control law design that are needed to maintain the shape of a formation in two-dimensional space, while the formation moves as a cohesive whole. Bearing-based shape control for a formation of mobile agents involves the design of distributed control laws that ensure the formation moves, so that bearing constraints maintain some desired values. The second part of this article focuses on the design of a distributed control scheme for nonholonomic agents to solve the bearing-based formation shape control problem. In particular, a control law using feedback linearisation is proposed based on shape variables. We simulate the shape control behaviour on differential drive agents for an exemplary bearing rigid formation using the results obtained in the first and second parts of this article.

Minimal and redundant bearing rigidity: Conditions and applications

This article studies the notions of minimal and 1-redundant bearing rigidity. A necessary and sufficient condition for the numbers of edges in a graph of n (n ≥ 3) vertices to be minimally bearing rigid (MBR) in Rd (d ≥ 2) is proposed. If 3 ≤ n ≤ d + 1, a graph is MBR if and only if it is the cycle graph. In case n > d + 1, a generically bearing rigid graph is minimal if it has precisely 1 + [n-2/d-1] × d + mod(n - 2, d - 1) + sgn(mod(n - 2, d - 1)) edges. Then, several conditions for 1-redundant bearing rigidity are derived. Based on the mathematical conditions, some algorithms for generating generically, minimally, and 1-redundantly bearing rigid graphs are given. Furthermore, two applications of the new notions to optimal network design and formation merging are also reported.

Theory and methods for bearing rigidity recovery

In the bearing-based localization and formation control problem, we can uniquely determine or control the relative positions of all the agents up to a common scale if and only if the problem is rigid. The notion of rigidity therefore plays a central role. In some situations (for instance, restoring rigidity after an agent leaves a formation), it is necessary to solve the rigidity recovery problem: find a way to turn a non-rigid problem into a rigid one by adding new bearing measurements. In this paper, we first provide new theoretical insights on rigidity, and on the minimum number of additional bearing measurements necessary to ensure this property in a non-rigid problem. We then provide algorithms to select which edges to add.

Elementary operations for rigidity restoration and persistence analysis of multi-agent system

This work focuses on the construction of rigid formation from non-rigid ones in the two-dimensional space. Analogously to operations of Henneberg sequence aiming to guarantee the minimal rigidity of formation, two new operations are introduced, allowing one to sequentially build any rigid graph by connecting non-rigid ones. A systematic construction sequence is developed based on proposed operations, and is shown to be able to restore rigidity by introducing minimum number of new edges during the construction process. Further applications of the proposed operations are also presented, one of which is successfully employed in the problem of persistence analysis of directed graphs, and can verify the persistence of a given graph with a speed two times faster comparing with existing solution.

Rigidity-preserving team partitions in multiagent networks

Motivated by the strong influence network rigidity has on collaborative systems, in this paper, we consider the problem of partitioning a multiagent network into two sub-teams, a bipartition, such that the resulting sub-teams are topologically rigid. In this direction, we determine the existence conditions for rigidity-preserving bipartitions, and provide an iterative algorithm that identifies such partitions in polynomial time. In particular, the relationship between rigid graph partitions and the previously identified Z-link edge structure is given, yielding a feasible direction for graph search. Adapting a supergraph search mechanism, we then detail a methodology for discerning graphs cuts that represent valid rigid bipartitions. Next, we extend our methods to a decentralized context by exploiting leader election and an improved graph search to evaluate feasible cuts using only local agent-to-agent communication. Finally, full algorithm details and pseudocode are provided, together with simulation results that verify correctness and demonstrate complexity.

A distributed simplex algorithm for degenerate linear programs and multi-agent assignments

In this paper we propose a novel distributed algorithm to solve degenerate linear programs on asynchronous peer-to-peer networks with distributed information structures. We propose a distributed version of the well-known simplex algorithm for general degenerate linear programs. A network of agents, running our algorithm, will agree on a common optimal solution, even if the optimal solution is not unique, or will determine infeasibility or unboundedness of the problem. We establish how the multi-agent assignment problem can be efficiently solved by means of our distributed simplex algorithm. We provide simulations supporting the conjecture that the completion time scales linearly with the diameter of the communication graph.

A distributed version of the hungarian method for multirobot assignment

In this paper, we propose a distributed version of the Hungarian method to solve the well-known assignment problem. In the context of multirobot applications, all robots cooperatively compute a common assignment that optimizes a given global criterion (e.g., the total distance traveled) within a finite set of local computations and communications over a peer-to-peer network. As a motivating application, we consider a class of multirobot routing problems with “spatiotemporal” constraints, i.e., spatial targets that require servicing at particular time instants. As a means of demonstrating the theory developed in this paper, the robots cooperatively find online suboptimal routes by applying an iterative version of the proposed algorithm in a distributed and dynamic setting. As a concrete experimental test bed, we provide an interactive “multirobot orchestral” framework, in which a team of robots cooperatively plays a piece of music on a so-called orchestral floor.

We consider the case when each robot is to be assigned a goal position, the individual robots are interchangeable, and the goal formation can be scaled or translated.We compute the costs for all candidate pairs of initial, goal robot assignments as functions of the parameters of the goal formation, and partition the parameter space into equivalence classes invariant to the cost order using computational geometry techniques. We compute a minimum completion time assignment for an equivalence class by formulating it as a linear bottleneck assignment problem (LBAP). To improve efficiency, we solve the LBAP problem for each equivalence class by incrementally updating the solution as the formation parameters are varied. This work is motivated by applications that include the motion of droplet formations in digital microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices, and of robot and drone formations in the plane.

Distributed formation control with permutation symmetries

In distributed control applications such as coverage or consensus by multiple mobile agents, a great new challenge is the development of motion algorithms that dynamically determine the positions of the agents in the formation using only local information. In this paper, we address this challenge using two novel ideas. First, we represent a formation as a rotational and translational invariant configuration in the free space and employ distributed consensus algorithms to guarantee that all agents agree on the rotation and translation of the final formation configuration. Second, local market-based coordination protocols dynamically determine a permutation of the agents in the formation, while artificial potential fields are used to drive the group of agents to the desired formation. Integration of the overall system results in a distributed, multi- agent, hybrid system which, under a connectivity assumption on the underlying communication network, is shown to always converge to the desired formation. Furthermore, the number of explored permutations is at most polynomial with the number of agents, while scalability of our approach is illustrated by nontrivial computer simulations.

在多移动智能体覆盖或一致性等分布式控制应用中，一大新挑战是开发仅利用局部信息就能动态确定编队中智能体位置的运动算法。本文通过两个创新思路应对这一挑战：一是将编队表示为自由空间中旋转和平移不变的构型，采用分布式一致性算法确保所有智能体就最终编队构型的旋转和平移达成一致；二是基于局部市场的协调协议动态确定编队中智能体的排列顺序，同时利用人工势场驱动智能体群体到达期望编队。
系统整合与收敛性分析
将上述部分整合为分布式多智能体混合系统，在底层通信网络满足连通性假设的情况下，该系统被证明总能收敛到期望编队。

Distributed multi-robot formation control among obstacles: A geometric and optimization approach with consensus

This paper presents a distributed method for navigating a team of robots in formation in 2D and 3D environments with static and dynamic obstacles. The robots are assumed to have a reduced communication and visibility radius and share information with their neighbors. Via distributed consensus the robots compute (a) the convex hull of the robot positions and (b) the largest convex region within free space. The robots then compute, via sequential convex programming, the locally optimal parameters for the formation within this convex neighborhood of the robots. Reconfiguration is allowed, when required, by considering a set of target formations. The robots navigate towards the target collision-free formation with individual local planners that account for their dynamics. The approach is efficient and scalable with the number of robots and performs well in simulations with up to sixteen quadrotors.

Distributed multi-robot task assignment and formation control

Distributed task assignment for multiple agents raises fundamental and novel problems in control theory and robotics. A new challenge is the development of distributed algorithms that dynamically assign tasks to multiple agents, not relying on a priori assignment information. We address this challenge using market-based coordination protocols where the agents are able to bid for task assignment with the assumption that every agent has knowledge of the maximum number of agents that any given task can accommodate. We show that our approach always achieves the desired assignment of agents to tasks after exploring at most a polynomial number of assignments, dramatically reducing the combinatorial nature of discrete assignment problems. We verify our algorithm through both simulation and experimentation on a team of non-holonomic robots performing distributed formation stabilization and group splitting and merging.

Distributed Swarm Formation Using Mobile Agents

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for controlling a fleet of swarm robots that construct three-dimensional forms. The swarm robots coordinate with each other through network communication, and compose formations such as polyhedrons presented as spherical coordinates. Our control algorithm achieves communication through mobile software agents, which introduce control programs to robots that initially have no information about the formation. Mobile software agents are autonomous objects that can migrate from one robot to other robots through a communication network and can deliver control programs as they are needed. We have made our swarm robot system to mimic the behaviors of the leafcutter ants. A leafcutter ant is a typical social insect and uses pheromone for communication. In our robot control system, we have implemented ants and pheromones as mobile software agents. We call the mobile software agents that drive the mobile robots as ant agents, and call the other agents that provide communication as pheromone agents. The ant agents drive the swarm robots to locations identified by the pheromone agents. Each ant agent has only partial information. There is no need for either a central control or an agent that has the entire design of the formation. In order to diffuse the partial information among the neighboring robots, each ant agent generates pheromone agents and dispatches them to the surrounding robots. Dispatched pheromone agent looks for a proper ant agent to influence towards a desired relative location. It is the ant agent that actually drives the robot by following the guidance of the pheromone agent, and the collective actions of ant agents and pheromone agents achieve the composition of the objective formation. We have implemented a simulator based on our algorithm and conducted numerical experiments. The results demonstrate that our mobile robot control system is feasible and efficient in practice in practical situations.

Efficient multi-robot formations using distributed optimization

This paper studies the problem of multi-robot formations by means of distributed optimization. In order to reach a desired configuration, robots can adjust two elements, the set of desired positions and the particular role of each robot within the formation. Although the two problems, positions and assignment, have been deeply studied separately, there are few solutions that consider both of them together. The main contribution of this paper is a distributed algorithm that computes the optimal solution for both parameters simultaneously, accompanied by proof that the set of optimal positions is independent of the assignment of the team of robots to those positions. This demonstration also allows us to compute the optimal positions by means of a standard distributed averaging method. In order to solve the assignment problem, we consider an existing distributed simplex algorithm and propose a modification that takes into account the variations in costs generated by the averaging algorithm. The whole method is provably correct to achieve the optimal solution.

Optimal role and position assignment in multi-robot freely reachable formations

Many multi-robot problems require the achievement of formations as part of the overall mission. This work considers a scenario in which unlabeled homogeneous robots must adopt a given formation pattern buildable anywhere in the environment. This involves finding the relative pose of the formation in regard to the initial robot positions, understood as a translation and a rotation; and the optimal assignment of the role of each robot within the formation. This paper provides an optimal solution for the combined parameters of translation, rotation and assignment that minimizes total displacement. To achieve this objective we first formally prove that the three decision variables are separable. Since computing the optimal assignment without accounting for the rotation is a computationally expensive problem, we propose an algorithm that efficiently computes the optimal roles together with the rotation. The algorithm is provably correct and finds the optimal solution in finite time. A distributed implementation is also discussed. Simulation results characterize the complexity of our solution and demonstrate its effectiveness.

SCRAM: Scalable collision-avoiding role assignment with minimal-makespan for formational positioning

Teams of mobile robots often need to divide up subtasks efficiently. In spatial domains, a key criterion for doing so may depend on distances between robots and the subtasks' locations. This paper considers a specific such criterion, namely how to assign interchangeable robots, represented as point masses, to a set of target goal locations within an open two dimensional space such that the makespan (time for all robots to reach their target locations) is minimized while also preventing collisions among robots. We present scaleable (computable in polynomial time) role assignment algorithms that we classify as being SCRAM (Scalable Collision-avoiding Role Assignment with Minimal-makespan). SCRAM role assignment algorithms use a graph theoretic approach to map agents to target goal locations such that our objectives for both minimizing the makespan and avoiding agent collisions are met. A system using SCRAM role assignment was originally designed to allow for decentralized coordination among physically realistic simulated humanoid soccer playing robots in the partially observable, non-deterministic, noisy, dynamic, and limited communication setting of the RoboCup 3D simulation league. In its current form, SCRAM role assignment generalizes well to many realistic and real-world multiagent systems, and scales to thousands of agents.

SCRAM 角色分配算法设计
提出可扩展（多项式时间内可计算）的角色分配算法，将其归类为 SCRAM（最小完工时间的可扩展避碰角色分配算法）。该算法采用图论方法将智能体映射到目标位置，同时满足最小化完工时间和避免智能体碰撞的目标。

Shape formation in homogeneous swarms using local task swapping

The task of shape formation in robot swarms can often be reduced to two tasks—assigning goal locations to each robot and creating a collision-free path to that goal. In this article, we present a distributed algorithm that solves these tasks concurrently, enabling a swarm of robots to move and form a shape quickly and without collision. A user can specify a desired shape as an image, send that to a swarm of identically programmed robots, and the swarm will move all robots to goal locations within the desired shape. This algorithm was executed on a swarm of up to 1024 simulated robots and a swarm of 100 real robots, showing that it reliably converges to all robots forming the shape.

Simultaneous optimization of assignments and goal formations for multiple robots

This paper presents algorithms to simultaneously compute the optimal assignments and formation parameters for a team of robots from a given initial formation to a variable goal formation (where the shape of the goal formation is given, and its scale and location parameters must be optimized). We assume the n robots are identical spheres. We use the sum of squared travel distances as the objective function to be minimized, which also ensures that the trajectories are collision free. We show that this assignment with variable goal formation problem can be transformed to a linear sum assignment problem (LSAP) with pseudo costs that we establish are independent of the formation parameters. The transformed problem can then be solved using the Hungarian algorithm in O (n3) time. Thus the assignment problem with variable goal formations using this new approach has the same O (n3) time complexity as the standard assignment problem with fixed goal formations. Results from simulations on 200 and 600 robots are presented to show the algorithm is sufficiently fast for practical applications.

STRATA: unified framework for task assignments in large teams of heterogeneous agents

Large teams of heterogeneous agents have the potential to solve complex multi-task problems that are intractable for a single agent working independently. However, solving complex multi-task problems requires leveraging the relative strengths of the different kinds of agents in the team. We present Stochastic TRAit-based Task Assignment (STRATA), a unified framework that models large teams of heterogeneous agents and performs effective task assignments. Specifically, given information on which traits (capabilities) are required for various tasks, STRATA computes the assignments of agents to tasks such that the trait requirements are achieved. Inspired by prior work in robot swarms and biodiversity, we categorize agents into different species (groups) based on their traits. We model each trait as a continuous variable and differentiate between traits that can and cannot be aggregated from different agents. STRATA is capable of reasoning about both species-level and agent-level variability in traits. Further, we define measures of diversity for any given team based on the team’s continuous-space trait model. We illustrate the necessity and effectiveness of STRATA using detailed experiments based in simulation and in a capture-the-flag game environment.

Coverage problems in sensor networks: A survey

Sensor networks, which consist of sensor nodes each capable of sensing environment and transmitting data, have lots of applications in battlefield surveillance, environmental monitoring, industrial diagnostics, etc. Coverage which is one of the most important performance metrics for sensor networks reflects how well a sensor field is monitored. Individual sensor coverage models are dependent on the sensing functions of different types of sensors, while network-wide sensing coverage is a collective performance measure for geographically distributed sensor nodes. This article surveys research progress made to address various coverage problems in sensor networks. We first provide discussions on sensor coverage models and design issues. The coverage problems in sensor networks can be classified into three categories according to the subject to be covered. We state the basic coverage problems in each category, and review representative solution approaches in the literature. We also provide comments and discussions on some extensions and variants of these basic coverage problems.

Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is the task of determining a path that passes over all points of an area or volume of interest while avoiding obstacles. This task is integral to many robotic applications, such as vacuum cleaning robots, painter robots, autonomous underwater vehicles creating image mosaics, demining robots, lawn mowers, automated harvesters, window cleaners and inspection of complex structures, just to name a few. A considerable body of research has addressed the CPP problem. However, no updated surveys on CPP reflecting recent advances in the field have been presented in the past ten years. In this paper, we present a review of the most successful CPP methods, focusing on the achievements made in the past decade. Furthermore, we discuss reported field applications of the described CPP methods. This work aims to become a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in CPP. Likewise, this work aims to present a comprehensive review of the recent breakthroughs in the field, providing links to the most interesting and successful works.

Decentralized minimum-energy coverage control for time-varying density functions

This paper introduces a minimum-energy approach to the problem of time-varying coverage control. The coverage objective, encoded by a locational cost, is reformulated as a constrained optimization problem that can be solved in a decentralized fashion. This allows the robots to achieve a centroidal Voronoi tessellation by running a decentralized controller even in case of a time-varying density function. We demonstrate that this approach makes no assumptions on the rate of change of the density function and performs the computations in an approximation-free manner. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated in simulation as well as on a team of mobile robots.

Robust area coverage with connectivity maintenance

Robot swarms herald the ability to solve complex tasks using a large collection of simple devices. However, engineering a robotic swarm is far from trivial, with a major hurdle being the definition of the control laws leading to the desired globally coordinated behavior. Communication is a key element for coordination and it is considered one of the current most important challenges for swarm robotics. In this paper, we study the problem of maintaining robust swarm connectivity while performing a coverage task based on the Voronoi tessellation of an area of interest. We implement our methodology in a team of eight Khepera IV robots. With the assumptions that robots have a limited sensing and communication range-and cannot rely on centralized processing-we propose a tri-objective control law that outperforms other simpler strategies (e.g. a potential-based coverage) in terms of network connectivity, robustness to failure, and area coverage.

schmickl2006collective
Collective perception in a robot swarm

In swarm robotics, hundreds or thousands of robots have to reach a common goal autonomously. Usually, the robots are small and their abilities are very limited. The autonomy of the robots requires that the robots’ behaviors are purely based on their local perceptions, which are usually rather limited. If the robot swarm is able to join multiple instances of individual perceptions to one big global picture (e.g. to collectively construct a sort of map), then the swarm can perform efficiently and such a swarm can target complex tasks. We here present two approaches to realize ‘collective perception’ in a robot swarm. Both require only limited abilities in communication and in calculation. We compare these strategies in different environments and evaluate the swarm’s performance in simulations of fluctuating environmental conditions and with varying parameter settings.

在集群机器人技术中，数百或数千个机器人需自主达成共同目标。这些机器人通常体积小、功能有限，其自主性要求行为完全基于自身局部感知 —— 而这种感知能力往往较为薄弱。若机器人集群能将多个个体的局部感知整合为完整的全局信息（例如共同构建某种地图），就能高效执行任务，甚至应对复杂任务。

Multi-robot search and rescue: A potential field based approach

This paper describes two implementations of a potential field sharing multi-robot system which we term as pessimistic and optimistic. Unlike other multirobot systems in which coordination is designed explicitly, it is an emergent property of our system. The robots perform no reasoning and are purely reactive in nature. We extend our previous work in simulated search and rescue where there was only one target to the search for multiple targets. As in our previous work the sharing systems with six or more robots outperformed the equivalent non-sharing system. We conclude that potential field sharing has a positive impact on robots involved in a search and rescue problem.

A cellular automata ant memory model of foraging in a swarm of robots

This study proposes a cellular automata ant memory model (CAAM) that controls a robot swarm when undertaking the foraging task in a previously known environment with nests. The floor field is well known to all robots, which share the same environment, communicating through the inverted pheromone. This substance is deposited by each swarm robot over every step in searching, which results in a repulsive force between team members. Besides, a short-term memory inspired by Tabu Search is applied to enable robots to remember their last positions and to avoid useless explorations. On the other hand, homing is based on the behavior observed in pedestrian evacuation, resulting in an attractive force through the nests. Moreover, a dynamic information is used to avoid queues of robots and bottlenecks next to the nests. Each robot step is a first choice movement with a stochastic conflict solver, which results in a non-deterministic characteristic to the model. The proposed model was implemented and submitted to several simulations to evaluate its resultant behavior. Different environmental conditions were employed to refine its intrinsic parameters. The results shown that the proposed model is able to perform the foraging task in a competitive way: in searching the swarm perform a good environment coverage and in homing robots are able to find the most adequate nests.

A comparison of path planning strategies for autonomous exploration and mapping of unknown environments

To date, a large number of algorithms to solve the problem of autonomous exploration and mapping has been presented. However, few efforts have been made to compare these techniques. In this paper, an extensive study of the most important methods for autonomous exploration and mapping of unknown environments is presented.

Multi-UAV routing for area coverage and remote sensing with minimum time

This paper presents a solution for the problem of minimum time coverage of ground areas using a group of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) equipped with image sensors. The solution is divided into two parts:(i) the task modeling as a graph whose vertices are geographic coordinates determined in such a way that a single UAV would cover the area in minimum time; and (ii) the solution of a mixed integer linear programming problem, formulated according to the graph variables defined in the first part, to route the team of UAVs over the area. The main contribution of the proposed methodology, when compared with the traditional vehicle routing problem’s (VRP) solutions, is the fact that our method solves some practical problems only encountered during the execution of the task with actual UAVs. In this line, one of the main contributions of the paper is that the number of UAVs used to cover the area is automatically selected by solving the optimization problem. The number of UAVs is influenced by the vehicles’ maximum flight time and by the setup time, which is the time needed to prepare and launch a UAV. To illustrate the methodology, the paper presents experimental results obtained with two hand-launched, fixed-wing UAVs.

方法核心优势
与传统车辆路径问题（VRP）解决方案相比，该方法的主要贡献在于能解决实际无人机执行任务时才会遇到的部分实际问题。其中关键贡献之一是，通过求解优化问题可自动确定覆盖该区域所需的无人机数量。无人机数量受其最大飞行时间和准备时间（即无人机准备与发射所需的时间）影响。

Efficient boustrophedon multi-robot coverage: an algorithmic approach

This paper presents algorithmic solutions for the complete coverage path planning problem using a team of mobile robots. Multiple robots decrease the time to complete the coverage, but maximal efficiency is only achieved if the number of regions covered multiple times is minimized. A set of multi-robot coverage algorithms is presented that minimize repeat coverage. The algorithms use the same planar cell-based decomposition as the Boustrophedon single robot coverage algorithm, but provide extensions to handle how robots cover a single cell, and how robots are allocated among cells. Specifically, for the coverage task our choice of multi-robot policy strongly depends on the type of communication that exists between the robots. When the robots operate under the line-of-sight communication restriction, keeping them as a team helps to minimize repeat coverage. When communication between the robots is available without any restrictions, the robots are initially distributed through space, and each one is allocated a virtually-bounded area to cover. A greedy auction mechanism is used for task/cell allocation among the robots. Experimental results from different simulated and real environments that illustrate our approach for different communication conditions are presented.

Multi-objective multi-robot path planning in continuous environment using an enhanced genetic algorithm

This paper presents a hybrid approach for path planning of multiple mobile robots in continuous environments. For this purpose, first, an innovative Artificial Potential Field (APF) algorithm is presented to find all feasible paths between the start and destination locations in a discrete gridded environment. Next, an enhanced Genetic Algorithm (EGA) is developed to improve the initial paths in continuous space and find the optimal path between start and destination locations. The proposed APF works based on a time-efficient deterministic scheme to find a set of feasible initial paths and is guaranteed to find a feasible path if one exists. The EGA utilizes five customized crossover and mutation operators to improve the initial paths. In this paper, path length, smoothness, and safety are combined to form a multi-objective path planning problem. In addition, the proposed method is extended to deal with multiple mobile robot path planning problem. For this purpose, a new term is added to the objective function which measures the distance between robots and a collision removal operator is added to the EGA to remove possible collision between paths. To assess the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, 12 planar environments with different sizes and complexities were examined. Evaluations showed that the control parameters of the proposed algorithm do not affect the performance of the EGA considerably. Moreover, a comparative study has been made between the proposed algorithm, A*, PRM, B-RRT and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The comparative study showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms PSO as well as well-recognized deterministic (A*) and probabilistic (PRM and B-RRT) path planning algorithms in terms of path length, run time, and success rate. Finally, simulations proved the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for a four-robot path planning problem. In this case, not only the proposed algorithm determined collision-free paths, but also it found near optimal solution for all robots.

多机器人路径规划扩展
为处理多移动机器人路径规划问题，对该方法进行扩展：在目标函数中添加衡量机器人间距离的新项，在 EGA 中加入碰撞消除算子，以移除路径间可能的碰撞。
算法评估与对比
在 12 个不同尺寸和复杂度的平面环境中评估算法效率，结果表明算法控制参数对 EGA 性能影响较小。将所提算法与 A*、PRM、B-RRT 和粒子群优化（PSO）算法进行对比，结果显示在路径长度、运行时间和成功率方面，该算法优于 PSO 以及公认的确定性（A*）和概率性（PRM、B-RRT）路径规划算法。

Multi-robot path planning based on multi-objective particle swarm optimization

In this paper, a new method is proposed for the path planning of multi-robots in unknown environments. The method is inspired by multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and is named multi-robot MOPSO. It considers shortness, safety, and smoothness. Due to the obscurity of the environment, the robots should decide the moving direction based on the information gathered by sensors only such that the optimal path between the start and goal positions can be found at the end of the algorithm. Sharing knowledge among the navigating robots is necessary to achieve this aim. So, a new concept, named the probabilistic window, is introduced in this paper. It combines the current information obtained through the robot sensors and experiences of the previous robots to select the paths that seem more likely to achieve higher fitness in the mentioned objectives. The proposed method has an outstanding performance on different complex benchmarks, and the results have shown that it is more effective and efficient compared with the classic and the state-of-the-art methods.

Optimal multirobot path planning on graphs: Complete algorithms and effective heuristics

We study optimal multirobot path planning on graphs (MPP) over four minimization objectives: the makespan (last arrival time), the maximum (single-robot traveled) distance, the total arrival time, and the total distance. Having established previously that these objectives are distinct and NP-hard to optimize, in this paper, we focus on efficient algorithmic solutions for solving these optimal MPP problems. Toward this goal, we first establish a one-to-one solution mapping between MPP and a special type of multiflow network. Based on this equivalence and integer linear programming (ILP), we design novel and complete algorithms for optimizing over each of the four objectives. In particular, our exact algorithm for computing optimal makespan solutions is a first that is capable of solving extremely challenging problems with robot-vertex ratios as high as 100%. Then, we further improve the computational performance of these exact algorithms through the introduction of principled heuristics, at the expense of slight optimality loss. The combination of ILP model based algorithms and the heuristics proves to be highly effective, allowing the computation of 1.x-optimal solutions for problems containing hundreds of robots, densely populated in the environment, often in just seconds.

本文研究图上多机器人最优路径规划（MPP）问题，围绕四个最小化目标展开：完工时间（最后到达时间）、最大（单机器人行驶）距离、总到达时间和总距离。此前已证实这些目标相互独立且优化难度为 NP 难，本文聚焦于高效求解这些最优 MPP 问题的算法方案。
问题等价映射与算法设计
首先建立 MPP 与一类特殊多流网络之间的一一对应解映射关系。基于这种等价性和整数线性规划（ILP），设计针对四个目标分别优化的新型完备算法。其中，求解最优完工时间的精确算法为首创，能够解决机器人与顶点比例高达 100% 的高难度问题。
启发式优化与性能提升
通过引入基于原理的启发式策略，在牺牲微小最优性的前提下，进一步提升这些精确算法的计算性能。ILP 模型算法与启发式策略的结合被证明极具成效，能够在数秒内为包含数百个机器人、环境中高密度分布的问题，计算出 1.x 倍最优解。

Cooperative multi-vehicle search and coverage problem in uncertain environments

A decentralized approach is proposed to solve a cooperative multi-vehicle search and coverage problem in uncertain environments. Two different types of vehicle are used for search and coverage tasks. The search vehicles have a priori probability maps of targets in the environment and they update these maps based on the measurement of their sensors during the search mission. They use a limited look-ahead dynamic programming algorithm to find their own path individually while their objective is to maximize the amount of information gathered by the whole team. The task of service vehicles is to spread out over the environment to optimally cover the terrain. A locational optimization technique is used to assign Voronoi regions to vehicles and the stability of coverage system is guaranteed using LaSalle's invariance principle. The service vehicles modify their configuration using the updated probability maps which are provided by the search vehicles. Simulations show that the proposed approach offers improved performance compared to conventional coverage methods.

Complete multi-robot coverage of unknown environments with minimum repeated coverage

In this paper, an algorithm for the complete multi-robot coverage of a connected space with unknown obstacles is presented. The proposed algorithm mainly operates by maintaining, as far as possible, small uncovered regions between covered areas and obstacles. In addition, the bounds on the amount of repeated coverage and time required for complete coverage are also investigated. Furthermore, it is shown that repeated coverage can occur only around regions where the paths between obstacles are less than twice the width of the robots’ coverage range. This property holds even when the robots have no a priori knowledge of the environment, and therefore helps to prevent unnecessary wastage of time and resources.

Multi-agent time-based decision-making for the search and action problem

Many robotic applications, such as search-and-rescue, require multiple agents to search for and perform actions on targets. However, such missions present several challenges, including cooperative exploration, task selection and allocation, time limitations, and computational complexity. To address this, we propose a decentralized multi-agent decision-making framework for the search and action problem with time constraints. The main idea is to treat time as an allocated budget in a setting where each agent action incurs a time cost and yields a certain reward. Our approach leverages probabilistic reasoning to make near-optimal decisions leading to maximized reward. We evaluate our method in the search, pick, and place scenario of the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC), by using a probability density map and reward prediction function to assess actions. Extensive simulations show that our algorithm outperforms benchmark strategies, and we demonstrate system integration in a Gazebo-based environment, validating the framework's readiness for field application

Multi-robot exploration and fire searching

Exploration of an unknown environment is a fundamental concern in mobile robotics. This paper presents an approach for cooperative multi-robot exploration, fire searching and mapping in an unknown environment. The proposed approach aims to minimize the overall exploration time, making it possible to localize fire sources in an efficient way. In order to achieve this goal, the robots should cooperate in an effective way, so they can individually and simultaneously explore different areas of the environment while they identify fire sources. The proposed approach employs a decentralized frontier based exploration method which evaluates the cost-gain ratio to navigate to target way-points. The target way-points are obtained by an A* search variant algorithm. The potential field method is used to control the robots motion while avoiding obstacles. When a robot detects a fire, it estimates the flame's position by triangulation. The communication between the robots is done in a decentralized control way where they share the necessary data to generate the map of the environment and to perform cooperative actions in a behavioral decision making way. This paper presents simulation and experimental results of the proposed exploration and fire search method and concludes with a discussion of the obtained results and future improvements.

Field coverage and weed mapping by UAV swarms

The demands from precision agriculture (PA) for high-quality information at the individual plant level require to re-think the approaches exploited to date for remote sensing as performed by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A swarm of collaborating UAVs may prove more efficient and economically viable compared to other solutions. To identify the merits and limitations of a swarm intelligence approach to remote sensing, we propose here a decentralised multi-agent system for a field coverage and weed mapping problem, which is efficient, intrinsically robust and scalable to different group sizes. The proposed solution is based on a reinforced random walk with inhibition of return, where the information available from other agents (UAVs) is exploited to bias the individual motion pattern. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach under a variety of experimental conditions, accounting also for limited communication range and different routing protocols.

Random walk exploration for swarm mapping

Research in swarm robotics has shown that robot swarms are effective in the exploration of unknown environments. However, little work has been devoted to port the exploration capabilities of robot swarms into the context of mapping. Indeed, conceiving robot swarms that can map an unknown environment in a robust, scalable, and flexible way is an open issue. In this paper, we investigate a swarm mapping method in which robots first individually map the environment by random walk and then, we merge their maps into a single, global one. We focus on five variants of random walk and we compare the quality of the maps that a swarm produces when exploring the environment using these variants. Our experiments with ten e-puck robots show that, despite the individual maps being incomplete by themselves, it is possible to collectively map the environment by merging them. We found that the quality of the map depends on the exploration behavior of the individuals. Our results suggest that one of the variants of random walk, the ballistic motion, gives better mapping results for closed environments.

Exploration in extreme environments with swarm robotic system

Missions in extreme environments such as exploration and mapping of chemical leakage, radiation and high temperature are hazardous for human workers. Therefore, robotic solutions can be utilised in these applications. Swarm robotics is an alternative approach to traditional robotics, with potential to increase the efficiency of robotic solutions in an extreme environment. Swarm robotic systems are low-cost, robust and scalable. In this paper, we focused on an exploration scenario for use in an extreme environment application. The scenario for this study was to explore the different levels of radioactive or chemical leakage from drums in a nuclear storage facility. The environment and mobile robot used for this work, Mona, were modelled in the V-REP simulation software. The effects of experimental parameters, i.e. the number of robots and complexity of the storage facility, on the efficiency of the exploration system were evaluated. The results revealed that, an increase in population size increased the performance of the exploration significantly. Moreover, the complexity of the environment did not have significant impact on the performance of the system.

Characteristics of object-searching and object-fetching behaviors of multi-robot system using local communication

We introduce a methodology using emergent intelligence to generate some of useful behaviors in a multi-robot system consisting of robot modules equipped with a simple function and intelligence mechanism. The generated abilities of a multi-robot system are as follows: one is the ability to explore their unknown area; the other is the ability to return to their original position from any position in their work area. We have demonstrated these behaviors by using our manufactured robots and by computer simulation. The characteristics of two basic abilities in the emergent intelligence are investigated. One ability, which is the searching ability or space-coverage ability, is generated by random-walk-like moving that emerges by dynamic interaction in each robot when there is an increase in the population size of the multi-robot system. The other ability, which is the returning ability, is increased effectively using a vector-field generated by the signal flow via a communication network. The paper introduces two approaches to building a communication network. One is to use a static signal-transmission robot and the other is to use a moving signal-transmission robot. When any one of individual robots finds a certain area and then returns to its original area, the total ability obtained by the method using the moving signal transmission robot is superior to that by the method using a static signal-transmission robot. On the other hand, the probability evaluated as the ratio of the searching frequency to the returning frequency for certain time duration, is almost the same between the two approaches. We conclude that the high probability of returning to the original position after searching is a fundamental ability utilizing a vector-field via a communication network when compared to the return probability without utilizing a communication network.

Minimal navigation solution for a swarm of tiny flying robots to explore an unknown environment

Swarms of tiny flying robots hold great potential for exploring unknown, indoor environments. Their small size allows them to move in narrow spaces, and their light weight makes them safe for operating around humans. Until now, this task has been out of reach due to the lack of adequate navigation strategies. The absence of external infrastructure implies that any positioning attempts must be performed by the robots themselves. State-of-the-art solutions, such as simultaneous localization and mapping, are still too resource demanding. This article presents the swarm gradient bug algorithm (SGBA), a minimal navigation solution that allows a swarm of tiny flying robots to autonomously explore an unknown environment and subsequently come back to the departure point. SGBA maximizes coverage by having robots travel in different directions away from the departure point. The robots navigate the environment and deal with static obstacles on the fly by means of visual odometry and wall-following behaviors. Moreover, they communicate with each other to avoid collisions and maximize search efficiency. To come back to the departure point, the robots perform a gradient search toward a home beacon. We studied the collective aspects of SGBA, demonstrating that it allows a group of 33-g commercial off-the-shelf quadrotors to successfully explore a real-world environment. The application potential is illustrated by a proof-of-concept search-and-rescue mission in which the robots captured images to find “victims” in an office environment. The developed algorithms generalize to other robot types and lay the basis for tackling other similarly complex missions with robot swarms in the future.

Effect of random walk methods on searching efficiency in swarm robots for area exploration

The objective of area exploration is to traverse the area effectively and random walk methods are the most commonly used searching strategy for swarm robots. Existing research mainly compares the effectiveness of various random walk methods through experimental verification, which has relatively large limitations. In order to make the application of the random walk methods more convenient, this paper quantitatively analyzes the searching efficiency (SE) of random walk methods. Firstly, the formula of the mean square displacement (MSD) of the robot position is given, and it is shown that the mean and the variance of the random step length are the factors that affect the SE. In addition, in order to produce the suitable step length, a truncated random walk method is constructed to make the generated step lengths follow a given distribution and the step lengths are within a specified range, thereby improving the SE. Thirdly, the correlations between the step length threshold (SLT), the area of the region, and the number of robots are provided based on MSD and truncated random walk method. When the area of region and the number of robots are fixed, there exists a SLT. When the expectation of the step length is greater than SLT, the swarm robots can achieve the highest SE. The area exploration task of swarm robots are carried out in simulation experiments and the coverage ratio is used to evaluate the SE of each random walk method. The experimental results show that when the area and the number of robots are given, there exist an optimal step length, which can enable the robots to achieve the optimal search.

Collective L{\'e}vy walk for efficient exploration in unknown environments

One of the key tasks of autonomous mobile robots is to explore the unknown environment under limited energy and deadline conditions. In this paper, we focus on one of the most efficient random walks found in the natural and biological system, i.e., Lévy walk. We show how Lévy properties disappear in larger robot swarm sizes because of spatial interferences and propose a novel behavioral algorithm to preserve Lévy properties at the collective level. Our initial findings hold potential to accelerate target search processes in large unknown environments by parallelizing Lévy exploration using a group of robots.

A cognitive agent-based model for multi-robot coverage at a city scale

In this article, we model a behavior-based strategy of autonomous coverage and exploration at the scale of a city with multiple robots. The behavioral components are motivated by Cepeda et al. (Sensors 12 (9): 12772–12797, 2012) and extended to incorporate into a generic cellular-automata based agent model. These agents are representing homogenous robots with reactive control. Deliberative approaches requires large scale map and large memory, which slowdowns the execution. Our approach is reactive and simple, that is, robots have no prior information about the environment and do not generate a route map as they traverse. However, other robots in neighborhood are detected using local sensors.

本文提出一种基于行为的策略模型，用于多机器人在城市尺度下的自主覆盖与探索任务。该行为组件借鉴 Cepeda 等人（2012 年《传感器》期刊，12 卷 9 期：12772–12797 页）的研究，并扩展整合至通用的元胞自动机智能体模型中。
机器人模型与控制特性
这些智能体代表具有反应式控制的同构机器人。 deliberative 方法（慎思式方法）需要大规模地图和大量内存，会降低执行效率。本文提出的方法具有反应式和简洁性特点：机器人对环境无先验信息，移动过程中不生成路线图，但可通过局部传感器检测周边其他机器人。

Terrain coverage with ant robots: a simulation study

In this paper, we study a simple means for coordinating teams of simple agents. In particular, we study ant robots and how they can cover terrain once or repeatedly by leaving markings in the terrain, similar to what ants do. These markings can be sensed by all robots and allow them to cover terrain even if they do not communicate with each other except via the markings, do not have any kind of memory, do not know the terrain, cannot maintain maps of the terrain, nor plan complete paths. The robots do not even need to be localized, which completely eliminates solving difficult and time-consuming localization problems. In this paper, we use real-time heuristic search methods to implement ant robots and present a simulation study with several real-time heuristic search methods to study their properties for terrain coverage. Our experiments show that all of the real-time heuristic search methods robustly cover terrain even if the robots are moved without realizing this, some robots fail, and some markings get destroyed. These results demonstrate that terrain coverage with real-time heuristic search methods is an interesting alternative to more conventional terrain coverage methods.

Efficient spatial coverage by a robot swarm based on an ant foraging model and the L{\'e}vy distribution

This work proposes a control law for efficient area coverage and pop-up threat detection by a robot swarm inspired by the dynamical behavior of ant colonies foraging for food. In the first part, performance metrics that evaluate area coverage in terms of characteristics such as rate, completeness and frequency of coverage are developed. Next, the Keller–Segel model for chemotaxis is adapted to develop a virtual-pheromone-based method of area coverage. Sensitivity analyses with respect to the model parameters such as rate of pheromone diffusion, rate of pheromone evaporation, and white noise intensity then identify and establish noise intensity as the most influential parameter in the context of efficient area coverage and establish trends between these different parameters which can be generalized to other pheromone-based systems. In addition, the analyses yield optimal values for the model parameters with respect to the proposed performance metrics. A finite resolution of model parameter values were tested to determine the optimal one. In the second part of the work, the control framework is expanded to investigate the efficacy of non-Brownian search strategies characterized by Lévy flight, a non-Brownian stochastic process which takes variable path lengths from a power-law distribution. It is shown that a control law that incorporates a combination of gradient following and Lévy flight provides superior area coverage and pop-up threat detection by the swarm. The results highlight both the potential benefits of robot swarm design inspired by social insect behavior as well as the interesting possibilities suggested by considerations of non-Brownian noise.

本文提出一种控制律，受蚁群觅食动态行为启发，用于机器人集群高效区域覆盖和突发威胁检测。
区域覆盖评估与虚拟信息素方法
首先，构建评估区域覆盖性能的指标体系，从覆盖速率、完整性和频率等特征衡量覆盖效果。随后，改进趋化性凯勒 - 塞格尔（Keller–Segel）模型，开发基于虚拟信息素的区域覆盖方法。通过对信息素扩散速率、蒸发速率和白噪声强度等模型参数进行敏感性分析，确定噪声强度是影响高效区域覆盖的最关键参数，并建立这些参数间的变化趋势 —— 该趋势可推广至其他基于信息素的系统。同时，结合所提性能指标，通过测试有限分辨率的模型参数值，得出各参数的最优取值。
非布朗搜索策略扩展与优化
第二部分扩展控制框架，研究以莱维飞行（一种路径长度服从幂律分布的非布朗随机过程）为特征的非布朗搜索策略的有效性。结果表明，融合梯度跟随与莱维飞行的控制律，能使集群获得更优的区域覆盖效果和突发威胁检测能力。

Robot swarm for efficient area coverage inspired by ant foraging: the case of adaptive switching between brownian motion and l{\'e}vy flight

Design of robot swarms inspired by self-organization in social insect groups is currently an active research area with a diverse portfolio of potential applications. In this work, the authors propose a control law for efficient area coverage by a robot swarm in a 2D spatial domain, inspired by the unique dynamical characteristics of ant foraging. The novel idea pursued in the effort is that dynamic, adaptive switching between Brownian motion and Lévy flight in the stochastic component of the search increases the efficiency of the search. Influence of different pheromone (the virtual chemotactic agent that drives the foraging) threshold values for switching between Lévy flights and Brownian motion is studied using two performance metrics — area coverage and visit entropy. The results highlight the advantages of the switching strategy for the control framework, particularly in cases when the object of the search is scarce in quantity or getting depleted in real-time.

受社会性昆虫群体自组织行为启发的机器人集群设计，是当前活跃的研究领域，具有多样化的潜在应用场景。本文受蚂蚁觅食独特的动态特性启发，提出一种用于机器人集群在二维空间域高效区域覆盖的控制律。
核心搜索策略设计
研究的创新点在于，在搜索的随机组件中动态、自适应地切换布朗运动与莱维飞行，可提升搜索效率。通过区域覆盖范围和访问熵两个性能指标，研究不同信息素（驱动觅食行为的虚拟趋化剂）阈值对布朗运动与莱维飞行切换的影响。
策略优势与适用场景
结果凸显了该切换策略在控制框架中的优势，尤其适用于搜索目标数量稀少或实时消耗的场景。

Local policies for efficiently patrolling a triangulated region by a robot swarm

We present and analyze methods for patrolling and surveillance in an environment with a distributed swarm of robots with limited capabilities. Our approach is based on a distributed triangulation of the work space, in which a set of p stationary sensors provides coverage control; in addition, there are r mobile robots that can move between the sensors. Building on our prior work on structured exploration of unknown spaces with multi-robot systems, we can make use of a triangulation that is constructed in a distributed fashion and guarantees good local navigation properties, even when sensors and robots have very limited capabilities.

Energy-efficient indoor search by swarms of simulated flying robots without global information

Swarms of flying robots are a promising alternative to ground-based robots for search in indoor environments with advantages such as increased speed and the ability to fly above obstacles. However, there are numerous problems that must be surmounted including limitations in available sensory and on-board processing capabilities, and low flight endurance. This paper introduces a novel strategy to coordinate a swarm of flying robots for indoor exploration that significantly increases energy efficiency. The presented algorithm is fully distributed and scalable. It relies solely on local sensing and low-bandwidth communication, and does not require absolute positioning, localisation, or explicit world-models. It assumes that flying robots can temporarily attach to the ceiling, or land on the ground for efficient surveillance over extended periods of time. To further reduce energy consumption, the swarm is incrementally deployed by launching one robot at a time. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that increasing the time between consecutive robot launches significantly lowers energy consumption by reducing total swarm flight time, while also decreasing collision probability. As a trade-off, however, the search time increases with increased inter-launch periods. These effects are stronger in more complex environments. The proposed localisation-free strategy provides an energy efficient search behaviour adaptable to different environments or timing constraints.

飞行机器人集群是室内环境搜索中地面机器人的理想替代方案，具有速度更快、可飞越障碍物等优势。但该方案需克服诸多问题，包括传感器和机载处理能力有限、续航时间短等。本文提出一种新型协同策略，用于飞行机器人集群室内探索，可显著提升能源效率。
策略核心设计
所提算法完全分布式且可扩展，仅依赖局部传感和低带宽通信，无需绝对定位、定位系统或显式世界模型。算法假设飞行机器人可临时附着于天花板或降落在地面，实现长时间高效监视。为进一步降低能耗，集群采用增量部署模式，每次仅发射一台机器人。
仿真实验结果与规律
大量仿真实验表明，增加连续机器人发射间隔，可通过减少集群总飞行时间显著降低能耗，同时降低碰撞概率。但存在权衡关系：发射间隔延长会导致搜索时间增加，且这种影响在更复杂环境中更为明显。
策略优势
该无定位策略实现了节能搜索行为，可适应不同环境或时间约束。

A review on improving the autonomy of unmanned surface vehicles through intelligent collision avoidance manoeuvres

In recent years unmanned vehicles have grown in popularity, with an ever increasing number of applications in industry, the military and research within air, ground and marine domains. In particular, the challenges posed by unmanned marine vehicles in order to increase the level of autonomy include automatic obstacle avoidance and conformance with the Rules of the Road when navigating in the presence of other maritime traffic. The USV Master Plan which has been established for the US Navy outlines a list of objectives for improving autonomy in order to increase mission diversity and reduce the amount of supervisory intervention. This paper addresses the specific development needs based on notable research carried out to date, primarily with regard to navigation, guidance, control and motion planning. The integration of the International Regulations for Avoiding Collisions at Sea within the obstacle avoidance protocols seeks to prevent maritime accidents attributed to human error. The addition of these critical safety measures may be key to a future growth in demand for USVs, as they serve to pave the way for establishing legal policies for unmanned vessels.

Navigation strategies for multiple autonomous mobile robots moving in formation

The problem of deriving navigation strategies for a fleet of autonomous mobile robots moving in formation is considered. Here each robot is represented by a particle with a spherical effective spatial domain and a specified cone of visibility. The global motion of each robot in the world space is described by the equations of motion of the robot's center of mass. First, methods for formation generation are discussed. Then, simple navigation strategies for robots moving in formation are derived. A sufficient condition for the stability of a desired formation pattern for a fleet of robots each equipped with the navigation strategy based on nearest neighbor tracking is developed. The dynamic behavior of robot fleets consisting of three or more robots moving in formation in a plane is studied by means of computer simulation.

Behavior-based swarm robotic search and rescue using fuzzy controller

Search and rescue (SAR) is one of the foremost issues in disaster management. A robust SAR mechanism can significantly reduce the number of causalities. This paper presents a behavior-based model for a swarm of small robots to perform an efficient SAR operation in an unknown environment. The swarm is guided by a dynamically selected virtual leader (VL). A self-contained dynamic goal-seeking mechanism, using behavior-based approach, is designed to search targets (victims). Under the leadership of VL, the proposed model retains the integrity of the swarm while driving it from its current position to referenced goals. Fuzzy logic has been used to design constituent behavioral modules, namely obstacle avoidance, alignment, and inter-robot cohesion. The model has been simulated to validate its efficiency and the findings reveal that robots moving as a swarm are more effective in the SAR process as compared to multiple single robots.

Multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping using particle filters

This paper describes an on-line algorithm for multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The starting point is the single-robot Rao-Blackwellized particle filter described by Hähnel et al., and three key generalizations are made. First, the particle filter is extended to handle multi-robot SLAM problems in which the initial pose of the robots is known (such as occurs when all robots start from the same location). Second, an approximation is introduced to solve the more general problem in which the initial pose of robots is not known a priori (such as occurs when the robots start from widely separated locations). In this latter case, it is assumed that pairs of robots will eventually encounter one another, thereby determining their relative pose. This relative attitude is used to initialize the filter, and subsequent observations from both robots are combined into a common map. Third and finally, a method is introduced to integrate observations collected prior to the first robot encounter, using the notion of a virtual robot travelling backwards in time. This novel approach allows one to integrate all data from all robots into a single common map.

本文提出一种多机器人同时定位与地图构建（SLAM）的在线算法，以 Hähnel 等人提出的单机器人 Rao-Blackwellized 粒子滤波为基础，实现了三项关键扩展。

Dynamic vehicle routing problems: Three decades and counting

Since the late 70s, much research activity has taken place on the class of dynamic vehicle routing problems (DVRP), with the time period after year 2000 witnessing a real explosion in related papers. Our paper sheds more light into work in this area over more than 3 decades by developing a taxonomy of DVRP papers according to 11 criteria. These are (1) type of problem, (2) logistical context, (3) transportation mode, (4) objective function, (5) fleet size, (6) time constraints, (7) vehicle capacity constraints, (8) the ability to reject customers, (9) the nature of the dynamic element, (10) the nature of the stochasticity (if any), and (11) the solution method. We comment on technological vis-à-vis methodological advances for this class of problems and suggest directions for further research. The latter include alternative objective functions, vehicle speed as decision variable, more explicit linkages of methodology to technological advances and analysis of worst case or average case performance of heuristics.

自 20 世纪 70 年代末以来，动态车辆路径规划问题（DVRP）领域开展了大量研究，2000 年后相关论文数量更是激增。本文通过建立包含 11 项标准的分类体系，梳理该领域 30 余年的研究成果，为相关工作提供更清晰的视角。

Cooperative object transport in multi-robot systems: A review of the state-of-the-art

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in designing multi-robot systems (hereafter MRSs) to provide cost effective, fault-tolerant and reliable solutions to a variety of automated applications. Here, we review recent advancements in MRSs specifically designed for cooperative object transport, which requires the members of MRSs to coordinate their actions to transport objects from a starting position to a final destination. To achieve cooperative object transport, a wide range of transport, coordination and control strategies have been proposed. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive summary for this relatively heterogeneous and fast-growing body of scientific literature. While distilling the information, we purposefully avoid using hierarchical dichotomies, which have been traditionally used in the field of MRSs. Instead, we employ a coarse-grain approach by classifying each study based on the transport strategy used; pushing-only, grasping and caging. We identify key design constraints that may be shared among these studies despite considerable differences in their design methods. In the end, we discuss several open challenges and possible directions for future work to improve the performance of the current MRSs. Overall, we hope to increasethe visibility and accessibility of the excellent studies in the field and provide a framework that helps the reader to navigate through them more effectively.

近年来，设计多机器人系统（MRSs）为各类自动化应用提供高性价比、容错性强且可靠的解决方案，受到越来越多的关注。本文综述专为协同目标运输设计的多机器人系统最新进展，这类任务要求多机器人系统成员协调动作，将目标物体从起始位置运输至最终目的地。
协同目标运输策略分类
为实现协同目标运输，学界已提出多种运输、协调与控制策略。本文旨在全面总结这一相对异质且快速发展的研究领域，刻意避开该领域传统的层级二分法分类方式，采用粗粒度分类法，根据所用运输策略将研究分为三类：纯推动式、抓取式和围笼式。
设计约束与未来方向
识别出这些研究尽管设计方法差异显著，但可能共享的核心设计约束。最后讨论当前多机器人系统面临的若干开放挑战及未来改进性能的可能方向。总体而言，本文希望提升该领域优秀研究的可见度与可及性，并提供一个框架，帮助读者更高效地梳理相关文献。

Multi-robot target detection and tracking: taxonomy and survey

Target detection and tracking encompasses a variety of decisional problems such as coverage, surveillance, search, patrolling, observing and pursuit-evasion along with others. These problems are studied by several communities, that tackle them using diverse formulations, hypotheses and approaches. This variety and the fact that target related robotics problems are pertinent for a large spectrum of applications has motivated a large amount of contributions, which have mostly been surveyed according to one or another viewpoint. In this article, our objective is to go beyond the frontiers of specific communities and specific problems, and to enlarge the scope of prior surveys. We define classes of missions and problems, and relate the results from various communities according to a unifying taxonomy. We review various work related to each class of problems identified in the taxonomy, highlighting the different approaches, models and results. Finally, we propose a transverse synthesis which analyses the approaches, models and lacks that are recurrent through all the tackled problems, and isolate the current main research directions.

Dynamic information routing in complex networks

Flexible information routing fundamentally underlies the function of many biological and artificial networks. Yet, how such systems may specifically communicate and dynamically route information is not well understood. Here we identify a generic mechanism to route information on top of collective dynamical reference states in complex networks. Switching between collective dynamics induces flexible reorganization of information sharing and routing patterns, as quantified by delayed mutual information and transfer entropy measures between activities of a network’s units. We demonstrate the power of this mechanism specifically for oscillatory dynamics and analyse how individual unit properties, the network topology and external inputs co-act to systematically organize information routing. For multi-scale, modular architectures, we resolve routing patterns at all levels. Interestingly, local interventions within one sub-network may remotely determine nonlocal network-wide communication. These results help understanding and designing information routing patterns across systems where collective dynamics co-occurs with a communication function.

灵活的信息路由是许多生物和人工网络功能的核心基础，但这类系统如何特异性地通信并动态路由信息，目前尚未被充分理解。本文提出一种通用机制，可在复杂网络的集体动态参考状态之上实现信息路由。
信息路由的动态切换机制
在集体动力学之间切换，会诱导信息共享和路由模式的灵活重组。这一过程可通过网络单元活动间的延迟互信息和传递熵指标进行量化。本文专门针对振荡动力学验证了该机制的有效性，并分析了单个单元特性、网络拓扑结构和外部输入如何协同作用，系统地组织信息路由。
多尺度模块化架构的路由特性
对于多尺度模块化架构，本文解析了各级别的路由模式。值得注意的是，单个子网络内的局部干预可能远程决定非局部的全网络通信。这些结果有助于理解和设计各类系统的信息路由模式，尤其是那些集体动力学与通信功能共存的系统。

Graph-theoretic connectivity control of mobile robot networks

We provide a theoretical framework for controlling graph connectivity in mobile robot networks. We discuss proximity-based communication models composed of disk-based or uniformly-fading-signal-strength communication links. A graph-theoretic definition of connectivity is provided, as well as an equivalent definition based on algebraic graph theory, which employs the adjacency and Laplacian matrices of the graph and their spectral properties. Based on these results, we discuss centralized and distributed algorithms to maintain, increase, and control connectivity in mobile robot networks. The various approaches discussed in this paper range from convex optimization and subgradient-descent algorithms, for the maximization of the algebraic connectivity of the network, to potential fields and hybrid systems that maintain communication links or control the network topology in a least restrictive manner. Common to these approaches is the use of mobility to control the topology of the underlying communication network. We discuss applications of connectivity control to multirobot rendezvous, flocking and formation control, where so far, network connectivity has been considered an assumption.

Distributed algorithms for reaching consensus on general functions

This paper presents analysis and design results for distributed consensus algorithms in multi-agent networks. We consider continuous consensus functions of the initial state of the network agents. Under mild smoothness assumptions, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions characterizing any algorithm that asymptotically achieves consensus. This characterization is the building block to obtain various design results for networks with weighted, directed interconnection topologies. We first identify a class of smooth functions for which one can synthesize in a systematic way distributed algorithms that achieve consensus. We apply this result to the family of weighted power mean functions, and characterize the exponential convergence properties of the resulting algorithms. We establish the validity of these results for scenarios with switching interconnection topologies. Finally, we conclude with two discontinuous distributed algorithms that achieve, respectively, max and min consensus in finite time.

Decentralized control of connectivity for multi-agent systems

In this paper we propose a decentralized algorithm to increase the connectivity of a multi-agent system. The connectivity property of the multi-agent system is quantified through the second smallest eigenvalue of the state dependent Laplacian of the proximity graph of agents. An exponential decay model is used to characterize the connection between agents. A supergradient algorithm is then used in conjunction with a recently developed decentralized algorithm for eigenvector computation to maximize the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of the proximity graph. A potential based control law is utilized to achieve the distances dictated by the supergradient algorithm. The algorithm is completely decentralized, where each agent receives information only from its neighbors, and uses this information to update its control law at each step of the iteration. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm

Stability of multiagent systems with time-dependent communication links

We study a simple but compelling model of network of agents interacting via time-dependent communication links. The model finds application in a variety of fields including synchronization, swarming and distributed decision making. In the model, each agent updates his current state based upon the current information received from neighboring agents. Necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the convergence of the individual agents' states to a common value are presented, thereby extending recent results reported in the literature. The stability analysis is based upon a blend of graph-theoretic and system-theoretic tools with the notion of convexity playing a central role. The analysis is integrated within a formal framework of set-valued Lyapunov theory, which may be of independent interest. Among others, it is observed that more communication does not necessarily lead to faster convergence and may eventually even lead to a loss of convergence, even for the simple models discussed in the present paper.

Consensus and cooperation in networked multi-agent systems

This paper provides a theoretical framework for analysis of consensus algorithms for multi-agent networked systems with an emphasis on the role of directed information flow, robustness to changes in network topology due to link/node failures, time-delays, and performance guarantees. An overview of basic concepts of information consensus in networks and methods of convergence and performance analysis for the algorithms are provided. Our analysis framework is based on tools from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and control theory. We discuss the connections between consensus problems in networked dynamic systems and diverse applications including synchronization of coupled oscillators, flocking, formation control, fast consensus in small-world networks, Markov processes and gossip-based algorithms, load balancing in networks, rendezvous in space, distributed sensor fusion in sensor networks, and belief propagation. We establish direct connections between spectral and structural properties of complex networks and the speed of information diffusion of consensus algorithms. A brief introduction is provided on networked systems with nonlocal information flow that are considerably faster than distributed systems with lattice-type nearest neighbor interactions. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the role of small-world effects on the speed of consensus algorithms and cooperative control of multivehicle formations.

On fault tolerance and scalability of swarm robotic systems

This paper challenges the common assumption that swarm robotic systems are robust and scalable by default. We present an analysis based on both reliability modelling and experimental trials of a case study swarm performing team work, in which failures are deliberately induced. Our case study has been carefully chosen to represent a swarm task in which the overall desired system behaviour is an emergent property of the interactions between robots, in order that we can assess the fault tolerance of a self-organising system. Our findings show that in the presence of worst-case partially failed robots the overall system reliability quickly falls with increasing swarm size. We conclude that future large scale swarm systems will need a new approach to achieving high levels of fault tolerance.

Generic, scalable and decentralized fault detection for robot swarms

Robot swarms are large-scale multirobot systems with decentralized control which means that each robot acts based only on local perception and on local coordination with neighboring robots. The decentralized approach to control confers number of potential benefits. In particular, inherent scalability and robustness are often highlighted as key distinguishing features of robot swarms compared with systems that rely on traditional approaches to multirobot coordination. It has, however, been shown that swarm robotics systems are not always fault tolerant. To realize the robustness potential of robot swarms, it is thus essential to give systems the capacity to actively detect and accommodate faults. In this paper, we present a generic fault-detection system for robot swarms. We show how robots with limited and imperfect sensing capabilities are able to observe and classify the behavior of one another. In order to achieve this, the underlying classifier is an immune system-inspired algorithm that learns to distinguish between normal behavior and abnormal behavior online. Through a series of experiments, we systematically assess the performance of our approach in a detailed simulation environment. In particular, we analyze our system’s capacity to correctly detect robots with faults, false positive rates, performance in a foraging task in which each robot exhibits a composite behavior, and performance under perturbations of the task environment. Results show that our generic fault-detection system is robust, that it is able to detect faults in a timely manner, and that it achieves a low false positive rate. The developed fault-detection system has the potential to enable long-term autonomy for robust multirobot systems, thus increasing the usefulness of robots for a diverse repertoire of upcoming applications in the area of distributed intelligent automation.

机器人集群是大规模多机器人系统，采用分散式控制 —— 每个机器人仅基于局部感知和与邻近机器人的局部协调开展行动。分散式控制方法具有多项潜在优势，尤其是固有的可扩展性和鲁棒性，常被视为其区别于传统多机器人协调系统的核心特征。然而，研究表明集群机器人系统并非始终具备容错能力。因此，要充分发挥机器人集群的鲁棒性潜力，必须赋予系统主动检测和适应故障的能力。

Safety in numbers: fault-tolerance in robot swarms

The swarm intelligence literature frequently asserts that swarms exhibit high levels of robustness. That claim is, however, rather less frequently supported by empirical or theoretical analysis. But what do we mean by a 'robust' swarm? How would we measure the robustness or – to put it another way – fault-tolerance of a robotic swarm? These questions are not just of academic interest. If swarm robotics is to make the transition from the laboratory to real-world engineering implementation, we would need to be able to address these questions in a way that would satisfy the needs of the world of safety certification. This paper explores fault-tolerance in robot swarms through Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) and reliability modelling. The work of this paper is illustrated by a case study of a wireless connected robot swarm, employing both simulation and real-robot laboratory experiments.

群体智能领域的文献常称集群具有高水平的鲁棒性，但这一观点很少得到实证或理论分析的支持。然而，我们所说的 “鲁棒” 集群究竟指什么？又该如何衡量机器人集群的鲁棒性 —— 或者说容错性？这些问题不仅具有学术意义，若集群机器人技术要从实验室走向实际工程应用，就必须以满足安全认证领域需求的方式解决这些问题。

Managing byzantine robots via blockchain technology in a swarm robotics collective decision making scenario

While swarm robotics systems are often claimed to be highly fault-tolerant, so far research has limited its attention to safe laboratory settings and has virtually ignored security issues in the presence of Byzantine robots—i.e., robots with arbitrarily faulty or malicious behavior. However, in many applications one or more Byzantine robots may suffice to let current swarm coordination mechanisms fail with unpredictable or disastrous outcomes. In this paper, we provide a proof-of-concept for managing security issues in swarm robotics systems via blockchain technology. Our approach uses decentralized programs executed via blockchain technology (blockchain-based smart contracts) to establish secure swarm coordination mechanisms and to identify and exclude Byzantine swarm members. We studied the performance of our blockchain-based approach in a collective decision-making scenario both in the presence and absence of Byzantine robots and compared our results to those obtained with an existing collective decision approach. The results show a clear advantage of the blockchain approach when Byzantine robots are part of the swarm.

尽管集群机器人系统常被宣称具有高容错性，但目前研究多局限于安全的实验室环境，几乎忽略了存在拜占庭机器人时的安全问题 —— 拜占庭机器人即行为任意故障或恶意的机器人。然而在许多应用中，哪怕存在一个或多个拜占庭机器人，都可能导致现有集群协调机制失效，引发不可预测或灾难性后果。

Task partitioning in swarms of robots: reducing performance losses due to interference at shared resources

The performance of large groups of robots is often limited by a commonly shared resource. This effect, termed interference, can have a large impact on robotic swarms. This article studies the issue of interference in a swarm of robots working on a harvesting task. The environment of the robots is spatially constrained, i.e., there is a commonly shared resource, the nest, which limits the group’s performance when used without any arbitration mechanism. The article studies the use of task partitioning for reducing concurrent accesses to the resource, and therefore limiting the impact of interference on the group’s performance. In our study, we spatially partition the environment into two subparts, thereby partitioning the corresponding harvesting task as well. We employ a simple method to allocate individuals to the partitions. The approach is empirically studied both in an environment with a narrow nest area and an environment without this constraint. The results of the task partitioning strategy are analyzed and compared to the case in which task partitioning is not employed.

大规模机器人集群的性能常受共享资源限制，这种被称为 “干扰” 的效应会对机器人集群产生显著影响。本文研究机器人集群执行采集任务时的干扰问题，机器人所处环境存在空间约束 —— 即存在一个共享资源（巢穴），若缺乏仲裁机制，该资源会限制集群性能。

Predictive Fault Tolerance for Autonomous Robot Swarms

Active fault tolerance is essential for robot swarms to retain long-term autonomy. Previous work on swarm fault tolerance focuses on reacting to electro-mechanical faults that are spontaneously injected into robot sensors and actuators. Resolving faults once they have manifested as failures is an inefficient approach, and there are some safety-critical scenarios in which any kind of robot failure is unacceptable. We propose a predictive approach to fault tolerance, based on the principle of preemptive maintenance, in which potential faults are autonomously detected and resolved before they manifest as failures. Our approach is shown to improve swarm performance and prevent robot failure in the cases tested.

主动容错是机器人集群维持长期自主性的关键。以往集群容错研究聚焦于应对机器人传感器和执行器中自发出现的机电故障，但故障显现为失效后再进行解决的方式效率低下，且在部分安全关键场景中，任何形式的机器人失效都是不可接受的。

Fault recovery in swarm robotics systems using learning algorithms

When faults occur in swarm robotic systems they can have a detrimental effect on collective behaviours, to the point that failed individuals may jeopardise the swarm's ability to complete its task. Although fault tolerance is a desirable property of swarm robotic systems, fault recovery mechanisms have not yet been thoroughly explored. Individual robots may suffer a variety of faults, which will affect collective behaviours in different ways, therefore a recovery process is required that can cope with many different failure scenarios. In this thesis, we propose a novel approach for fault recovery in robot swarms that uses Reinforcement Learning and Self-Organising Maps to select the most appropriate recovery strategy for any given scenario. The learning process is evaluated in both centralised and distributed settings. Additionally, we experimentally evaluate the performance of this approach in comparison to random selection of fault recovery strategies, using simulated collective phototaxis, aggregation and foraging tasks as case studies. Our results show that this machine learning approach outperforms random selection, and allows swarm robotic systems to recover from faults that would otherwise prevent the swarm from completing its mission. This work builds upon existing research in fault detection and diagnosis in robot swarms, with the aim of creating a fully fault-tolerant swarm capable of long-term autonomy.

集群机器人系统发生故障时，会对集体行为产生不利影响，严重时故障个体可能危及集群完成任务的能力。尽管容错性是集群机器人系统的理想特性，但故障恢复机制尚未得到深入研究。单个机器人可能出现多种故障，且这些故障会以不同方式影响集体行为，因此需要一种能应对多种故障场景的恢复流程。

Fault detection in a swarm of physical robots based on behavioral outlier detection

The ability to reliably detect faults is essential in many real-world tasks that robot swarms have the potential to perform. Most studies on fault detection in swarm robotics have been conducted exclusively in simulation, and they have focused on a single type of fault or a specific task. In a series of previous studies, we have developed a robust fault-detection approach in which robots in a swarm learn to distinguish between normal and faulty behaviors online. In this paper, we assess the performance of our fault-detection approach on a swarm of seven physical mobile robots. We experiment with three classic swarm robotics tasks and consider several types of faults in both sensors and actuators. Experimental results show that the robots are able to reliably detect the presence of hardware faults in one another even when the swarm behavior is changed during operation. This paper is thus an important step toward making robot swarms sufficiently reliable and dependable for real-world applications.

可靠的故障检测能力，对于集群机器人有望执行的众多实际任务至关重要。大多数集群机器人故障检测研究仅在仿真环境中开展，且聚焦于单一类型故障或特定任务。在先前的一系列研究中，我们已开发出一种稳健的故障检测方法，让集群中的机器人能够在线学习区分正常与故障行为。

Monitoring a robot swarm using a data-driven fault detection approach

Using swarm robotics system, with one or more faulty robots, to accomplish specific tasks may lead to degradation in performances complying with the target requirements. In such circumstances, robot swarms require continuous monitoring to detect abnormal events and to sustain normal operations. In this paper, an innovative exogenous fault detection method for monitoring robots swarm is presented. The method merges the flexibility of principal component analysis (PCA) models and the greater sensitivity of the exponentially-weighted moving average (EWMA) and cumulative sum (CUSUM) control charts to insidious changes. The method is tested and evaluated on a swarm of simulated foot-bot robots performing a circle formation task, via the viscoelastic control model. We illustrate through simulated data collected from the ARGoS simulator that a significant improvement in fault detection can be obtained by using the proposed method where compared to the conventional PCA-based methods (i.e., 
 and 
).

使用存在一台或多台故障机器人的集群机器人系统执行特定任务，可能导致性能下降，无法满足目标要求。这种情况下，集群机器人需要持续监控以检测异常事件，维持正常运行。

Exogenous fault detection and recovery for swarm robotics

A robotic swarm needs to maintain continuous operation even in the event of failure of one or more individual robots. Even with a small number of faulty robots, the time for achieving the task will be significantly increased. If the behaviors of biological systems are considered, a number of approaches based on communication, to detect damaged or injured cells or insects can be identified. In this research the transmission of position data between robots has been used as the main method of fault location. The transmission of this data permits members of a robotic swarm to identify and subsequently isolate a faulty robot, either in its drive train or position measurement system. This paper discusses the approach used and presents simulation results.

机器人集群即使在一台或多台个体机器人发生故障时，仍需维持持续运行。即便只有少量故障机器人，任务完成时间也会显著增加。借鉴生物系统的行为机制，可发现多种基于通信来检测受损细胞或昆虫的方法。

Exogenous fault detection in swarm robotic systems

Swarm robotic systems comprise many individual robots, and exhibit a degree of innate fault tolerance due to this built-in redundancy. They are robust in the sense that the complete failure of individual robots will have little detrimental effect on a swarm's overall collective behaviour. However, it has recently been shown that partially failed individuals may be harmful, and cause problems that cannot be solved by simply adding more robots to the swarm. Instead, an active approach to dealing with failed individuals is required for a swarm to continue operation in the face of partial failures. This thesis presents a novel method of exogenous fault detection that allows robots to detect the presence of faults in each other, via the comparison of expected and observed behaviour. Each robot predicts the expected behaviour of its neighbours by simulating them online in an internal replica of the real world. This expected behaviour is then compared against observations of their true behaviour, and any significant discrepancy is detected as a fault. This work represents the first step towards a distributed fault detection, diagnosis, and recovery process that would afford robot swarms a high degree of fault tolerance, and facilitate long-term autonomy.

集群机器人系统由大量个体机器人组成，凭借内置的冗余特性，具备一定程度的固有容错能力。从个体机器人完全失效对集群整体集体行为影响较小这一角度来说，它们具有鲁棒性。然而，近期研究表明，部分故障个体可能具有危害性，其引发的问题无法通过简单增加机器人数量来解决。相反，面对部分故障，集群需要采用主动应对故障个体的方法，才能维持持续运行。
外源性故障检测方法设计
本文提出一种新型外源性故障检测方法，通过对比期望行为与观测行为，让机器人能够相互检测故障。每个机器人通过在内部真实世界副本中在线仿真邻居机器人，预测其期望行为。随后将该期望行为与观测到的真实行为进行对比，任何显著差异都会被判定为故障。
研究意义
该研究为构建分布式故障检测、诊断与恢复流程迈出了第一步，有望使集群机器人具备高水平容错能力，为实现长期自主性提供支持。

Towards exogenous fault detection in swarm robotic systems

It has long been assumed that swarm systems are robust, in the sense that the failure of individual robots will have little detrimental effect on a swarm’s overall collective behaviour. However, Bjerknes and Winfield [1] have recently shown that this is not always the case, particularly in the event of partial failures (such as motor failure). The reliability modelling in [1] shows that overall system reliability rapidly decreases with swarm size, therefore this is a problem that cannot simply be solved by adding more robots to the swarm. Instead, future large-scale swarm systems will need an active approach to dealing with failed individuals if they are to achieve a high level of fault tolerance.

长期以来，人们普遍认为集群系统具有鲁棒性，即个体机器人失效对集群整体集体行为的不利影响较小。然而，Bjerknes 和 Winfield 近期的研究 [1] 表明，情况并非总是如此，尤其是在出现部分故障（如电机故障）时。
可靠性建模结论
文献 [1] 中的可靠性建模结果显示，随着集群规模增大，系统整体可靠性会迅速下降。因此，这一问题无法通过简单增加机器人数量来解决。
未来集群系统的容错需求
相反，未来大规模集群系统若要实现高水平容错能力，需要采用主动应对故障个体的方法。

christensen2009fireflies
From fireflies to fault-tolerant swarms of robots

One of the essential benefits of swarm robotic systems is redundancy. In case one robot breaks down, another robot can take steps to repair the failed robot or take over the failed robot's task. Although fault tolerance and robustness to individual failures have often been central arguments in favor of swarm robotic systems, few studies have been dedicated to the subject. In this paper, we take inspiration from the synchronized flashing behavior observed in some species of fireflies. We derive a completely decentralized algorithm to detect non-operational robots in a swarm robotic system. Each robot flashes by lighting up its on-board light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and neighboring robots are driven to flash in synchrony. Since robots that are suffering catastrophic failures do not flash periodically, they can be detected by operational robots. We explore the performance of the proposed algorithm both on a real-world swarm robotic system and in simulation. We show that failed robots are detected correctly and in a timely manner, and we show that a system composed of robots with simulated self-repair capabilities can survive relatively high failure rates.

集群机器人系统的核心优势之一是冗余性：若一台机器人发生故障，另一台机器人可采取措施修复故障机器人或接管其任务。尽管对个体故障的容错性和鲁棒性常被视为支持集群机器人系统的核心论据，但相关研究却较少。

Swarm relays: Distributed self-healing ground-and-air connectivity chains

The coordination of robot swarms – large decentralized teams of robots – generally relies on robust and efficient inter-robot communication. Maintaining communication between robots is particularly challenging in field deployments where robot motion, unstructured environments, limited computational resources, low bandwidth, and robot failures add to the complexity of the problem. In this paper we propose a novel lightweight algorithm that lets a heterogeneous group of robots navigate to a target in complex 3D environments while maintaining connectivity with a ground station by building a chain of robots. The fully decentralized algorithm is robust to robot failures, can heal broken communication links, and exploits heterogeneous swarms: when a target is unreachable by ground robots, the chain is extended with flying robots. We test the performance of our algorithm using up to 100 robots in a physics-based simulator with three mazes and several robot failure scenarios. We then validate the algorithm with physical platforms: 7 wheeled robots and 6 flying ones, in homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios in the lab and on the field.

机器人集群（大规模分散式机器人团队）的协调通常依赖稳健高效的机器人间通信。在野外部署场景中，机器人移动、非结构化环境、有限的计算资源、低带宽以及机器人故障等因素会增加通信维持的复杂性，使其更具挑战性。

Review on diagnosis techniques for intermittent faults in dynamic systems

In the past decades, with the rapid development of modern technologies, a special kind of fault, the intermittent fault (IF) has become a serious threat to system securities. Although fruitful research results have been obtained for fault diagnosis, most of them are concerned with permanent faults. Furthermore, up to now, there has been no overview on the diagnosis techniques for IFs in dynamic systems. In fact, IFs are common in a variety of fields, whereas their research is far from mature and many open issues still remain to be solved. Therefore, in this overview, our main objective is to attract direct attentions from more researchers and engineers into the fascinating area of IF diagnosis. In this paper, the concept, research background, challenges and research motivations of IFs are introduced. Then, current research into diagnostics of IFs is reviewed, along with discussions on their strengths, limitations, and future directions.

过去几十年，随着现代技术的快速发展，一种特殊的故障 —— 间歇性故障（IF）已成为威胁系统安全的严重隐患。尽管故障诊断领域已取得丰硕研究成果，但多数聚焦于永久性故障。此外，迄今为止，尚未有关于动态系统中间歇性故障诊断技术的综述文献。
间歇性故障研究现状与综述目的
间歇性故障在多个领域普遍存在，但其研究尚不成熟，仍有诸多开放问题亟待解决。因此，本文综述的核心目标是吸引更多科研人员和工程师关注这一极具研究价值的间歇性故障诊断领域。

Distributed intermittent fault detection for linear stochastic systems over sensor network

In this article, the problem of intermittent fault (IF) detection is investigated for linear stochastic systems over sensor networks, where the appearing and disappearing times, and magnitude of IF are all nondeterministic. By utilizing the moving-horizon estimator, a novel residual generator is designed to realize the distributed detection of IFs in sensor networks. Different from the traditional moving horizon estimation algorithms, weight matrices of the quadratic cost function in this article are regulated by an unreliability index of the prior estimate to suppress the smearing effect of IFs. In virtue of the matrix transformation method and statistical theory, estimator parameters are obtained and the detectability of a single IF is analyzed by using the residual. In order to avoid the collisions of detection results from different residuals, the global detectability condition is given for all IFs. A cooperative decision-making strategy is proposed such that the only detection result can be guaranteed, which includes the appearing and disappearing times of IFs, and the nodes suffering from IFs. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the derived results.

A novel intermittent fault detection algorithm and health monitoring for electronic interconnections

There are various occurrences and root causes that result in no-fault-found (NFF) events but an intermittent fault (IF) is the most frustrating. This paper describes the challenging and most important area of an IF detection and health monitoring that focuses toward NFF situation in electronics interconnections. The experimental work focuses on mechanically-induced intermittent conditions in connectors. This paper illustrates a test regime, which can be used to repeatedly reproduce intermittence in electronic connectors, while subjected to vibration. A novel algorithm is used to detect an IF in interconnection. It sends a sine wave and decodes the received signal for intermittent information from the channel. This algorithm has been simulated to capture an IF signature using PSpice (electronic circuit simulation software). A simulated circuit is implemented for practical verification. However, measurements are presented using an oscilloscope. The results of this experiment provide an insight into the limitations of existing test equipment and requirements for future IF detection techniques. Aside from scheduled maintenance, this paper considers the possibility for in-service intermittent detection to be built into future systems, i.e., can IFs be captured without external test gear?

导致无故障发现（NFF）事件的原因多种多样，但间歇性故障（IF）是最令人困扰的一种。本文聚焦电子互连中无故障发现场景，探讨极具挑战性且至关重要的间歇性故障检测与健康监测领域。

研究结果与延伸思考
实验结果揭示了现有测试设备的局限性，明确了未来间歇性故障检测技术的需求方向。除定期维护外，本文还探讨了在未来系统中集成在役间歇性故障检测功能的可能性，即能否在无需外部测试设备的情况下捕获间歇性故障。

Fiesta: Fast incremental euclidean distance fields for online motion planning of aerial robots

Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) is useful for online motion planning of aerial robots since it can easily query the distance and gradient information against obstacles. Fast incrementally built ESDF map is the bottleneck for conducting real-time motion planning. In this paper, we investigate this problem and propose a mapping system called FIESTA to build global ESDF map incrementally. By introducing two independent updating queues for inserting and deleting obstacles separately, and using Indexing Data Structures and Doubly Linked Lists for map maintenance, our algorithm updates as few as possible nodes using a BFS framework. Our ESDF map has high computational performance and produces near-optimal results. We show our method outperforms other up-to-date methods in term of performance and accuracy by both theory and experiments. We integrate FIESTA into a completed quadrotor system and validate it by both simulation and onboard experiments. We release our method as open-source software for the community 11https://github.com/hlx1996/FIESTA

Geometrically constrained trajectory optimization for multicopters

In this article, we present an optimization-based framework for multicopter trajectory planning subject to geometrical configuration constraints and user-defined dynamic constraints. The basis of the framework is a novel trajectory representation built upon our novel optimality conditions for unconstrained control effort minimization. We design linear-complexity operations on this representation to conduct spatial–temporal deformation under various planning requirements. Smooth maps are utilized to exactly eliminate geometrical constraints in a lightweight fashion. A variety of state-input constraints are supported by the decoupling of dense constraint evaluation from sparse parameterization and the backward differentiation of flatness map. As a result, this framework transforms a generally constrained multicopter planning problem into an unconstrained optimization that can be solved reliably and efficiently. Our framework bridges the gaps among solution quality, planning efficiency, and constraint fidelity for a multicopter with limited resources and maneuvering capability. Its generality and robustness are both demonstrated by applications to different flight tasks. Extensive simulations and benchmarks are also conducted to show its capability of generating high-quality solutions while retaining the computation speed against other specialized methods by orders of magnitude.

Unlocking aerobatic potential of quadcopters: Autonomous freestyle flight generation and execution

Quadcopter drones are capable of executing complex aerobatic maneuvers when controlled manually by skilled pilots but are limited to simple aerobatic actions when flying autonomously in open spaces. As such, this study introduces a comprehensive system that enables drones to generate and execute sophisticated aerobatic maneuvers in complex environments with dense obstacle distributions. A universal representation is proposed, succinctly capturing flight as a series of discrete aerobatic intentions. These intentions consist of topology and attitude changes, which can be combined in various ways to describe intricate flight maneuvers. A spatial-temporal joint optimization trajectory planner is also introduced to generate dynamically feasible trajectories that are as smooth as possible and devoid of collisions. In addition, we investigate unique yaw sensitivity issues in aerobatic flight and identify the inherent influence of differential flatness singularities on yaw rotations while avoiding associated dynamics issues. A series of ablation studies confirmed the necessity of these spatial-temporal joint optimization and yaw compensation strategies. Additional simulations and physical experiments validated the stability and feasibility of our proposed system for improving uncrewed aerial flight. The proposed system enables drones to autonomously achieve flight performance usually reserved for professional pilots, unlocking boundless potential for aerobatic flight evolution in uncrewed aerial vehicles.

Opportunities and Challenges in Human-Swarm Interaction: Systematic Review and Research Implications

We conducted a Systematic Literature Review on scientific papers that examined the interaction between operators and drone swarms based on the use of a command and control center. We present the results of a meta-analysis of nine scientific papers published in the ACM DL and IEEE Xplore databases. Our findings show that research on human-drone swarm interaction shows a disproportionate interest in hand gestures compared to other input modalities for drone swarm control. Furthermore, all articles reviewed exclusively explored gestures and the size of the swarm used in the studies was limited, with a median of 3.0 and an average of 3.8 drones per study. We compiled an inventory of interaction modalities, recognition techniques, and application types from the scientific literature, which is presented in this paper. On the basis of our findings, we propose four areas for future research that can guide scientific investigations and practical developments in this field.

Human interaction with robot swarms: A survey

Recent advances in technology are delivering robots of reduced size and cost. A natural outgrowth of these advances are systems comprised of large numbers of robots that collaborate autonomously in diverse applications. Research on effective autonomous control of such systems, commonly called swarms, has increased dramatically in recent years and received attention from many domains, such as bioinspired robotics and control theory. These kinds of distributed systems present novel challenges for the effective integration of human supervisors, operators, and teammates that are only beginning to be addressed. This paper is the first survey of human-swarm interaction (HSI) and identifies the core concepts needed to design a human-swarm system. We first present the basics of swarm robotics. Then, we introduce HSI from the perspective of a human operator by discussing the cognitive complexity of solving tasks with swarm systems. Next, we introduce the interface between swarm and operator and identify challenges and solutions relating to human-swarm communication, state estimation and visualization, and human control of swarms. For the latter, we develop a taxonomy of control methods that enable operators to control swarms effectively. Finally, we synthesize the results to highlight remaining challenges, unanswered questions, and open problems for HSI, as well as how to address them in future works.

技术的最新进展催生了尺寸更小、成本更低的机器人。这些进展自然催生出由大量机器人组成的系统，它们能在各类应用中自主协作。近年来，针对这类通常被称为 “集群” 的系统的有效自主控制研究急剧增加，并受到生物启发机器人学、控制理论等多个领域的关注。这类分布式系统为人类监督员、操作员和队友的有效整合带来了全新挑战，而这些挑战才刚刚开始被应对。本文是首篇关于人机集群交互（HSI）的综述，明确了设计人机集群系统所需的核心概念。

First-Person View Interfaces for Teleoperation of Aerial Swarms

Aerial swarms can substantially improve the effectiveness of drones in applications such as inspection, monitoring, and search for rescue. This is especially true when those swarms are made of several individual drones that use local sensing and coordination rules to achieve collective motion. Despite recent progress in swarm autonomy, human control and decision-making are still critical for missions where lives are at risk or human cognitive skills are required. However, first-person-view (FPV) teleoperation systems require one or more human operators per drone, limiting the scalability of these systems to swarms. This work investigates the performance, preference, and behaviour of pilots using different FPV interfaces for teleoperation of aerial swarms. Interfaces with single and multiple perspectives were experimentally studied with humans piloting a simulated aerial swarm through an obstacle course. Participants were found to prefer and perform better with views from the back of the swarm, while views from the front caused users to fly faster but resulted in more crashes. Presenting users with multiple views at once resulted in a slower completion time, and users were found to focus on the largest view, regardless of its perspective within the swarm.

空中集群能显著提升无人机在巡检、监测和搜救等应用中的效能。当集群由多台具备局部感知和协作规则的个体无人机组成，以实现集体运动时，这种提升尤为明显。尽管集群自主性近年来取得进展，但在涉及生命安全或需要人类认知能力的任务中，人类的控制和决策仍至关重要。然而，第一人称视角（FPV）遥控系统每台无人机需配备一名或多名操作员，限制了这类系统向集群规模扩展的可能性。
研究核心与实验设计
本研究探究飞行员使用不同 FPV 接口遥控空中集群时的性能、偏好和行为。通过实验研究单视角和多视角接口，让人类操控模拟空中集群穿越障碍路线。
实验结果分析
参与者更偏好集群后方视角，且使用该视角时表现更佳；
集群前方视角会让用户飞行速度更快，但碰撞次数更多；
同时呈现多视角会延长任务完成时间，且用户会专注于最大的视角窗口，无论其在集群中的位置如何。

A user study evaluation of predictive formal modelling at runtime in human-swarm interaction

Formal Modelling is often used as part of the design and testing process of software development to ensure that components operate within suitable bounds even in unexpected circumstances. We conducted a user study evaluation of predictive formal modelling (PFM) at runtime in a human-swarm mission to determine the benefit of PFM on performance and human-swarm interaction. A total of 180 participants were recruited to perform the role of aerial swarm operators delivering parcels to target locations in a simulation environment. The PFM model was integrated into the simulation software to inform the operator of the estimated mission completion time given the current number of drones deployed. The operator could increase the number of parcels delivered in any timestep by adding drones, which also increased costs, thus requiring the use of the minimum number of drones necessary to complete the task in the given time. We collected user feedback using standard survey questionnaires and measured performance using data obtained from the Human and Robot Interactive Swarm (HARIS) simulator. Our results show that PFM increased the performance of the human swarm team without significantly increasing the operators’ workload or affecting the system’s usability.

形式化建模常被用作软件开发设计与测试流程的一部分，以确保组件即使在意外情况下也能在合适范围内运行。本研究在人机集群任务中，对运行时预测性形式化建模（PFM）进行了用户研究评估，旨在明确 PFM 对任务性能和人机集群交互的增益效果。
实验设计
招募 180 名参与者扮演空中集群操作员，在仿真环境中完成向目标位置配送包裹的任务。将 PFM 模型集成到仿真软件中，根据当前部署的无人机数量，向操作员告知预估的任务完成时间。操作员可通过增加无人机数量，在任意时间步提升包裹配送量，但这也会增加成本，因此需要使用最少的无人机在规定时间内完成任务。
数据收集与结果
通过标准调查问卷收集用户反馈，并利用人机交互集群（HARIS）仿真器获取的数据衡量任务性能。结果显示，PFM 提升了人机集群团队的任务性能，且未显著增加操作员的工作负荷，也未影响系统的可用性。

Gesture based human-multi-robot swarm interaction and its application to an interactive display

A taxonomy for gesture-based interaction between a human and a group (swarm) of robots is described. Methods are classified into two categories. First, free-form interaction, where the robots are unconstrained in position and motion and the user can use deictic gestures to select subsets of robots and assign target goals and trajectories. Second, shape-constrained interaction, where the robots are in a configuration shape that can be modified by the user. In the later, the user controls a subset of meaningful degrees of freedom defining the overall shape instead of each robot directly. A multi-robot interactive display is described where a depth sensor is used to recognize human gesture, determining the commands sent to a group comprising tens of robots. Experimental results with a preliminary user study show the usability of the system.

本文提出一套人机与机器人集群（群体）基于手势交互的分类体系，将交互方法分为两类。
交互方法分类
自由形式交互：机器人的位置和运动不受约束，用户可通过指示性手势选择机器人子集，并为其分配目标任务和轨迹。
形状约束交互：机器人处于特定构型形状中，用户可修改该形状。这种模式下，用户无需直接控制每个机器人，而是控制定义整体形状的若干关键自由度。
交互系统设计与验证
设计了一种多机器人交互显示系统，通过深度传感器识别人类手势，进而确定发送给数十台机器人组成的集群的指令。初步用户研究的实验结果验证了该系统的可用性。

Controlling a team of robots with a single input

We present a novel end-to-end solution for distributed multirobot coordination that translates multitouch gestures into low-level control inputs for teams of robots. Highlighting the need for a holistic solution to the problem of scalable human control of multirobot teams, we present a novel control algorithm with provable guarantees on the robots' motion that lends itself well to input from modern tablet and smartphone interfaces. Concretely, we develop an iOS application in which the user is presented with a team of robots and a bounding box (prism). The user carefully translates and scales the prism in a virtual environment; these prism coordinates are wirelessly transferred to our server and then received as input to distributed onboard robot controllers. We develop a novel distributed multirobot control policy which provides guarantees on convergence to a goal with distance bounded linearly in the number of robots, and avoids interrobot collisions. This approach allows the human user to solve the cognitive tasks such as path planning, while leaving precise motion to the robots. Our system was tested in simulation and experiments, demonstrating its utility and effectiveness.

Personalized human-swarm interaction through hand motion

The control of collective robotic systems, such as drone swarms, is often delegated to autonomous navigation algorithms due to their high dimensionality. However, like other robotic entities, drone swarms can still benefit from being teleoperated by human operators, whose perception and decision-making capabilities are still out of the reach of autonomous systems. Drone swarm teleoperation is only at its dawn, and a standard human-swarm interface (HSI) is missing to date. In this study, we analyzed the spontaneous interaction strategies of naive users with a swarm of drones. We implemented a machine-learning algorithm to define a personalized Body-Machine Interface (BoMI) based only on a short calibration procedure. During this procedure, the human operator is asked to move spontaneously as if they were in control of a simulated drone swarm. We assessed that hands are the most commonly adopted body segment, and thus we chose a LEAP Motion controller to track them to let the users control the aerial drone swarm. This choice makes our interface portable since it does not rely on a centralized system for tracking the human body. We validated our HSIs generation algorithm on a set of participants in a realistic simulated environment, showing a positive user feedback and performance comparable with a remote controller after training. Our method leaves the user free to choose between position and velocity control only based on their body motion preferences.

由于集体机器人系统（如无人机集群）的高维度特性，其控制通常委托给自主导航算法。然而，与其他机器人实体一样，无人机集群仍能从人类操作员的遥控中获益 —— 人类的感知和决策能力仍是自主系统目前无法企及的。无人机集群遥控尚处于起步阶段，至今缺乏标准的人机集群接口（HSI）。
研究设计与核心方法
用户自发交互策略分析：分析无经验用户与无人机集群的自发交互策略，基于机器学习算法，仅通过简短的校准流程定义个性化的身体 - 机器接口（BoMI）。
校准流程与跟踪选择：校准过程中，要求人类操作员像控制模拟无人机集群一样自发移动。研究发现手部是最常用的身体部位，因此选择 LEAP Motion 控制器进行手部跟踪，实现对空中无人机集群的控制。该选择使接口具备便携性，无需依赖集中式人体跟踪系统。
系统验证与优势
在真实的仿真环境中，通过一组参与者验证了人机集群接口生成算法的有效性。结果显示，用户反馈积极，经过训练后，系统性能与遥控器相当。该方法允许用户仅根据自身身体运动偏好，自由选择位置控制或速度控制模式。

Gesturing at subswarms: Towards direct human control of robot swarms

The term human-swarm interaction (HSI) refers to the interaction between a human operator and a swarm of robots. In this paper, we investigate HSI in the context of a resource allocation and guidance scenario. We present a framework that enables direct communication between human beings and real robot swarms, without relying on a secondary display. We provide the user with a gesture-based interface that allows him to issue commands to the robots. In addition, we develop algorithms that allow robots receiving the commands to display appropriate feedback to the user. We evaluate our framework both in simulation and with real-world experiments. We conduct a summative usability study based on experiments in which participants must guide multiple subswarms to different task locations.

Assistive collision avoidance for quadrotor swarm teleoperation

This paper presents a method for controlling quadrotor swarms in an environment with obstacles, with an intuitive human-swarm interface operated by a single human user. Our method allows for the quadrotor swarm to maintain a desired formation, while also keeping the quadrotors a safe distance from obstacles and from one another. We use a Virtual Rigid Body abstraction to provide a bridge between the single human user and the quadrotor swarm, so that a human user can fly an arbitrarily large quadrotor swarm from a single joystick. By applying multiple vector fields, collisions are automatically avoided within the swarm of quadrotors, and between the quadrotors and obstacles, while the Virtual Rigid Body is controlled by the human user. Our method is demonstrated in hardware experiments with groups of quadrotor micro aerial vehicles teleoperated by a single human operator in a motion capture system.

Semiautonomous haptic teleoperation control architecture of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles

We propose a novel semiautonomous haptic teleoperation control architecture for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), consisting of three control layers: 1) UAV control layer, where each UAV is abstracted by, and is controlled to follow the trajectory of, its own kinematic Cartesian virtual point (VP); 2) VP control layer, which modulates each VP's motion according to the teleoperation commands and local artificial potentials (for VP-VP/VP-obstacle collision avoidance and VP-VP connectivity preservation); and 3) teleoperation layer, through which a single remote human user can command all (or some) of the VPs' velocity while haptically perceiving the state of all (or some) of the UAVs and obstacles. Master passivity/slave stability and some asymptotic performance measures are proved. Experimental results using four custom-built quadrotor-type UAVs are also presented to illustrate the theory.

Human swarm interaction: An experimental study of two types of interaction with foraging swarms

In this paper we present the first study of human-swarm interaction comparing two fundamental

control methods, selection and beacon control, made available to a human operator to control a
foraging swarm of robots. Selection and beacon control differ with respect to their temporal and
spatial influence on the swarm and enable an operator to generate different strategies from the basic
behaviors of the swarm. Selection control requires an active selection of groups of robots while
beacon control exerts an influence on nearby robots within a set range. Both control methods are
implemented in a testbed in which operators solve an information foraging problem by utilizing a set
of swarm behaviors. The robotic swarm has only local communication and sensing capabilities. The
number of robots in the swarm range from 50 to 200. Operator performance for each control method
is compared in a series of missions in different environments with no obstacles up to cluttered and
structured obstacles. In addition, performance is compared to simple and advanced autonomous
swarms. Thirty-two participants were recruited for participation in the study. Autonomous swarm
algorithms were tested in repeated simulations. Our results showed that selection control scales better to larger swarms and generally outperforms beacon control. Operators utilized different swarm
behaviors with different frequency across control methods, suggesting an adaptation to different
strategies induced by choice of control method. Simple autonomous swarms outperformed human
operators in open environments, but operators adapted better to complex environments with obstacles. Human controlled swarms fell short of task-specific benchmarks under all conditions. Our
results reinforce the importance of understanding and choosing appropriate types of human-swarm
interaction when designing swarm systems, in addition to choosing appropriate swarm behaviors

本文首次开展人机集群交互研究，对比两种基础交互类型 —— 暂称为间歇式交互和环境式交互。这两种类型通过两种控制方法具体体现，即选择控制和信标控制，操作员可借助这两种方法控制觅食机器人集群。
两种控制方法的核心差异
选择控制和信标控制对集群的时间和空间影响不同，能让操作员基于集群的基本行为生成不同策略。
选择控制需要主动选取机器人群组；信标控制则对设定范围内的附近机器人施加影响。
实验设计与变量
在实验平台中实现两种控制方法，操作员需利用一组集群行为解决信息觅食问题。
机器人集群仅具备局部通信和感知能力，规模为 50 至 200 台不等。
在无障碍物、障碍物密集、结构化障碍物等不同环境的系列任务中，对比两种控制方法下的操作员表现，并与简单和先进自主集群的性能进行比较。
招募 32 名参与者参与研究，通过重复仿真测试自主集群算法。
实验结果与结论
选择控制在更大规模集群中扩展性更好，总体性能优于信标控制；操作员在不同控制方法下使用集群行为的频率不同，表明会适应由控制方法选择所引导的不同策略。
简单自主集群在开阔环境中表现优于人类操作员，但人类操作员在有障碍物的复杂环境中适应性更强；在所有条件下，人类控制的集群均未达到任务特定基准。
研究结果表明，设计集群系统时，除选择合适的集群行为外，理解并选择恰当的人机集群交互类型也至关重要。
